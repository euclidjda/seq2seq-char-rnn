So now , O Lord , the God of Israel , let your word to your servant David , my father , come true , when you said , You will never be without a man to take his place on the seat of the kingdom of Israel before me
, if only your children give attention to their ways , walking before me as you have done .
So now, O God of Israel, it is my prayer that you will make your word come true which you said to your servant David, my father.
But is it truly possible that God may be housed on earth? see, heaven and the heaven of heavens are not wide enough to be your resting-place; how much less this house which I have made!
Still, let your heart be turned to the prayer of your servant, O Lord God, and to his prayer for grace; give ear to the cry and the prayer which your servant sends up to you this day;
That your eyes may be open to this house night and day, to this place of which you have said, My name will be there; hearing the prayer which your servant may make, turning to this place.
Give ear to the prayers of your servant, and the prayers of your people Israel, when they make their prayers, turning to this place; give ear in heaven your living-place, and hearing, have mercy.
If a man does wrong to his neighbour, and has to take an oath, and comes before your altar to take his oath in this house:
Then let your ear be open in heaven , and be the judge of your servants , giving your decision against the wrongdoer , so that punishment for his sins may come on his head ; and , by your decision , keeping from evil him who has done no
wrong .
When your people Israel are overcome in war, because of their sin against you; if they are turned to you again, honouring your name, making prayers to you and requesting your grace in this house:
Then give ear in heaven, and let the sin of your people Israel have forgiveness, and take them back again into the land which you gave to their fathers.
When heaven is shut up and there is no rain, because of their sin against you; if they make prayers with their faces turned to this place, honouring your name and turning away from their sin when you send trouble on them:
Then give ear in heaven , so that the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , may have forgiveness , when you make clear to them the good way in which they are to go ; and send rain on your land which you have given
to your people for their heritage .
If there is no food in the land , or if there is disease , or if the fruits of the earth are damaged through heat or water , locust or worm ; if their towns are shut in by their attackers ; whatever trouble , whatever disease there may
be :
Whatever prayer or request for your grace is made by any man, or by all your people Israel, whatever his trouble may be, whose hands are stretched out to this house:
Give ear in heaven your living-place, acting in mercy; and give to every man whose secret heart is open to you, the reward of all his ways; for you, and you only, have knowledge of the hearts of all the children of men:
So that they may give you worship all the days of their life in the land which you gave to our fathers.
And as for the man from a strange land, who is not of your people Israel; when he comes from a far country because of the glory of your name:
(For they will have news of your great name and your strong hand and your out-stretched arm;) when he comes to make his prayer, turning to this house:
Give ear in heaven your living-place , and give him his desire , whatever it may be ; so that all the peoples of the earth may have knowledge of your name , worshipping you as do your people Israel , and that they may see that this house which
I have put up is truly named by your name .
If your people go out to war against their attackers, by whatever way you may send them, if they make their prayer to the Lord, turning their faces to this town of yours and to this house which I have made for your name:
Give ear in heaven to their prayer and their cry for grace, and see right done to them.
If they do wrong against you , ( for no man is without sin , ) and you are angry with them and give them up into the power of those who are fighting against them , so that they take them away as prisoners into a strange land ,
far off or near ;
And if they take thought, in the land where they are prisoners, and are turned again to you, crying out in prayer to you in that land, and saying, We are sinners, we have done wrong, we have done evil;
And with all their heart and soul are turned again to you , in the land of those who took them prisoners , and make their prayer to you , turning their eyes to this land which you gave to their fathers , and to the town which you took
for yourself , and the house which I made for your name :
Then give ear to their prayer and to their cry in heaven your living-place, and see right done to them;
Answering with forgiveness the people who have done wrong against you, and overlooking the evil which they have done against you; let those who made them prisoners be moved with pity for them, and have pity on them;
For they are your people and your heritage, which you took out of Egypt, out of the iron fireplace;
Let your eyes be open to your servant's prayer for grace and to the prayer of your people Israel, hearing them when their cry comes to you.
For you made them separate from all the peoples of the earth, to be your heritage, as you said by Moses your servant, when you took our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God.
Then Solomon, after making all these prayers and requests for grace to the Lord, got up from his knees before the altar of the Lord, where his hands had been stretched out in prayer to heaven;
And, getting on his feet, he gave a blessing to all the men of Israel, saying with a loud voice,
Praise be to the Lord who has given rest to his people Israel, as he gave them his word to do; every word of all his oath, which he gave by the hand of Moses his servant, has come true.
Now may the Lord our God be with us as he was with our fathers; let him never go away from us or give us up;
Turning our hearts to himself, guiding us to go in all his ways, to keep his orders and his laws and his decisions, which he gave to our fathers.
And may these my words, the words of my prayer to the Lord, be before the Lord our God day and night, so that he may see right done to his servant and to his people Israel, day by day as we have need.
So that all the peoples of the earth may see that the Lord is God, and there is no other.
Then let your hearts be without sin before the Lord our God, walking in his laws and keeping his orders as at this day.
Now the king, and all Israel with him, were making offerings before the Lord.
And Solomon gave to the Lord for peace-offerings, twenty-two thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel kept the feast of the opening of the Lord's house.
The same day the king made holy the middle of the open square in front of the house of the Lord , offering there the burned offering and the meal offering and the fat of the peace-offerings ; for there was not room on the brass altar of the Lord
for the burned offerings and the meal offerings and the fat of the peace-offerings .
So Solomon and all Israel with him , a very great meeting , ( for the people had come together from the way into Hamath to the river of Egypt , ) kept the feast at that time before the Lord our God , for two weeks , even fourteen
days .
And on the eighth day he sent the people away , and , blessing the king , they went to their tents full of joy and glad in their hearts , because of all the good which the Lord had done to David his servant and to Israel his people
Now when Solomon came to the end of building the house of the Lord and the king's house, and all Solomon's desires, which he had in mind were effected;
The Lord came to him again in a vision, as he had done at Gibeon;
And the Lord said to him , Your prayers and your requests for grace have come to my ears : I have made holy this house which you have made , and I have put my name there for ever ; my eyes and my heart will be there at
all times .
As for you, if you will go on your way before me, as David your father did, uprightly and with a true heart, doing what I have given you orders to do, keeping my laws and my decisions;
Then I will make the seat of your rule over Israel certain for ever, as I gave my word to David your father, saying, You will never be without a man to be king in Israel.
But if you are turned from my ways, you or your children, and do not keep my orders and my laws which I have put before you, but go and make yourselves servants to other gods and give them worship:
Then I will have Israel cut off from the land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have made holy for myself , I will put away from before my eyes ; and Israel will be a public example , and a word of shame
among all peoples .
And this house will become a mass of broken walls, and everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder at it and make whistling sounds; and they will say, Why has the Lord done so to this land and to this house?
And their answer will be , Because they were turned away from the Lord their God , who took their fathers out of the land of Egypt ; they took for themselves other gods and gave them worship and became their servants : that is why the Lord has sent
all this evil on them .
Now at the end of twenty years, in which time Solomon had put up the two houses, the house of the Lord and the king's house,
(Hiram, king of Tyre, had given Solomon cedar-trees and cypress-trees and gold, as much as he had need of,) King Solomon gave Hiram twenty towns in the land of Galilee.
But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the towns which Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them.
And he said, What sort of towns are these which you have given me, my brother? So they were named the land of Cabul, to this day.
And Hiram sent the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold.
Now, this was the way of Solomon's system of forced work for the building of the Lord's house and of the king's house, and the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem and Megiddo and Gezer. ...
Pharaoh, king of Egypt, came and took Gezer, burning it down and putting to death the Canaanites living in the town, and he gave it for a bride-offering to his daughter, Solomon's wife. ...
... and Solomon was the builder of Gezer and Beth-horon the lower,
And Baalath and Tamar in the waste land, in that land;
And all the store-towns and the towns which Solomon had for his war-carriages and for his horsemen, and everything which it was his pleasure to put up in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land under his rule.
As for the rest of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not children of Israel;
Their children who were still in the land, and whom the children of Israel had not been able to put to complete destruction, them did Solomon put to forced work, to this day.
But Solomon did not put the children of Israel to forced work; they were the men of war, his servants, his captains, and his chiefs, captains of his war-carriages and of his horsemen.
These were the chiefs of the overseers of Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, in authority over the people who did the work.
At that time Solomon made Pharaoh's daughter come up from the town of David to the house which he had made for her: then he made the Millo.
Three times in the year it was Solomon's way to give burned offerings and peace-offerings on the altar he had made to the Lord, causing his fire-offering to go up on the altar before the Lord.
And King Solomon made a sea-force of ships in Ezion-geber, by Eloth, on the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
Hiram sent his servants, who were experienced seamen, in the sea-force with Solomon's men.
And they came to Ophir, where they got four hundred and twenty talents of gold, and took it back to King Solomon.
Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim, a Zuphite of the hill-country of Ephraim, named Elkanah; he was the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:
And he had two wives, one named Hannah and the other Peninnah: and Peninnah was the mother of children, but Hannah had no children.
Now this man went up from his town every year to give worship and to make offerings to the Lord of armies in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the Lord, were there.
And when the day came for Elkanah to make his offering, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and daughters, their part of the feast:
But to Hannah he gave one part, though Hannah was very dear to him, but the Lord had not let her have children.
And the other wife did everything possible to make her unhappy, because the Lord had not let her have children;
And year by year, whenever she went up to the house of the Lord, she kept on attacking her, so that Hannah gave herself up to weeping and would take no food.
Then her husband Elkanah said to her, Hannah, why are you weeping? and why are you taking no food? why is your heart troubled? am I not more to you than ten sons?
So after they had taken food and wine in the guest room, Hannah got up. Now Eli the priest was seated by the pillars of the doorway of the Temple of the Lord.
And with grief in her soul, weeping bitterly, she made her prayer to the Lord.
And she made an oath , and said , O Lord of armies , if you will truly take note of the sorrow of your servant , not turning away from me but keeping me in mind , and will give me a man-child , then I will give him
to the Lord all the days of his life , and his hair will never be cut .
Now while she was a long time in prayer before the Lord, Eli was watching her mouth.
For Hannah's prayer came from her heart, and though her lips were moving she made no sound: so it seemed to Eli that she was overcome with wine.
And Eli said to her, How long are you going to be the worse for drink? Put away the effects of your wine from you.
And Hannah, answering him, said, No, my lord, I am a woman whose spirit is broken with sorrow: I have not taken wine or strong drink, but I have been opening my heart before the Lord.
Do not take your servant to be a good-for-nothing woman: for my words have come from my stored-up sorrow and pain.
Then Eli said to her, Go in peace: and may the God of Israel give you an answer to the prayer you have made to him.
And she said, May your servant have grace in your eyes. So the woman went away, and took part in the feast, and her face was no longer sad.
And early in the morning they got up, and after worshipping before the Lord they went back to Ramah, to their house: and Elkanah had connection with his wife; and the Lord kept her in mind.
Now the time came when Hannah, being with child, gave birth to a son; and she gave him the name Samuel, Because, she said, I made a prayer to the Lord for him.
And the man Elkanah with all his family went up to make the year's offering to the Lord, and to give effect to his oath.
But Hannah did not go, for she said to her husband, I will not go till the child has been taken from the breast, and then I will take him with me and put him before the Lord, where he may be for ever.
And her husband Elkanah said to her , Do whatever seems right to you , but not till you have taken him from the breast ; only may the Lord do as he has said . So the woman , waiting there , gave her son milk till he was
old enough to be taken from the breast .
Then when she had done so, she took him with her, with a three-year old ox and an ephah of meal and a skin full of wine, and took him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh: now the child was still very young.
And when they had made an offering of the ox, they took the child to Eli.
And she said, O my lord, as your soul is living, my lord, I am that woman who was making a prayer to the Lord here by your side:
My prayer was for this child; and the Lord has given him to me in answer to my request:
So I have given him to the Lord; for all his life he is the Lord's. Then he gave the Lord worship there.
Then Samuel took the bottle of oil , and put the oil on his head and gave him a kiss and said , Is not the Lord with the holy oil making you ruler over Israel , his people ? and you will have authority over the people of the
Lord , and you will make them safe from the hands of their attackers round about them , and this will be the sign for you :
When you have gone away from me today , you will see two men by the resting-place of Rachel ' s body , in the land of Benjamin at Zelzah ; and they will say to you , The asses which you went in search of have come back ,
and now your father , caring no longer for the asses , is troubled about you , saying , What am I to do about my son ?
Then you are to go on from there , and when you come to the oak-tree of Tabor , you will see three men going up to God to Beth-el , one having with him three young goats and another three cakes of bread and another a skin full of
wine :
They will say, Peace be with you, and will give you two cakes of bread, which you are to take from them.
After that you will come to Gibeah , the hill of God , where an armed force of the Philistines is stationed : and when you come to the town , you will see a band of prophets coming down from the high place with instruments of music before them
; and they will be acting like prophets :
And the spirit of the Lord will come on you with power, and you will be acting like a prophet with them, and will be changed into another man.
And when these signs come to you, see that you take the chance which is offered you; for God is with you.
Then you are to go down before me to Gilgal, where I will come to you, for the offering of burned offerings and peace-offerings: go on waiting there for seven days till I come to you and make clear to you what you have to do.
And it came about, that when he went away from Samuel, God gave him a changed heart: and all those signs took place that day.
And when they came to Gibeah, a band of prophets came face to face with him; and the spirit of God came on him with power and he took his place among them as a prophet.
Now when Saul's old friends saw him among the band of prophets, the people said to one another, What has come to Saul, the son of Kish? Is even Saul among the prophets?
And one of the people of that place said in answer, And who is their father? So it became a common saying, Is even Saul among the prophets?
Then going away from the prophets, he came to the house.
And Saul's father's brother said to him and his servant, Where have you been? And he said, Searching for the asses: and when we saw no sign of them, we came to Samuel.
Then he said, And what did Samuel say to you?
And Saul, answering him, said, He gave us word that the asses had come back. But he said nothing to him of Samuel's words about the kingdom.
Then Samuel sent for the people to come together before the Lord at Mizpah;
And he said to the children of Israel, The Lord, the God of Israel, has said, I took Israel out of Egypt, and made you free from the hands of the Egyptians and from all the kingdoms which kept you down:
But today you are turned away from your God , who himself has been your saviour from all your troubles and sorrows ; and you have said to him , Put a king over us . So now , take your places before the Lord by your tribes and by
your thousands .
So Samuel made all the tribes of Israel come near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
Then he made the tribe of Benjamin come near by families, and the family of the Matrites was taken: and from them, Saul, the son of Kish, was taken: but when they went in search of him he was nowhere to be seen.
So they put another question to the Lord, Is the man present here? And the answer of the Lord was, He is keeping himself from view among the goods.
So they went quickly and made him come out; and when he took his place among the people, he was taller by a head than any of the people.
And Samuel said to all the people, Do you see the man of the Lord's selection, how there is no other like him among all the people? And all the people with loud cries said, Long life to the king!
Then Samuel gave the people the laws of the kingdom, writing them in a book which he put in a safe place before the Lord. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
And Saul went to Gibeah, to his house; and with him went the men of war whose hearts had been touched by God.
But certain good-for-nothing persons said, How is this man to be our saviour? And having no respect for him, they gave him no offering.
Then about a month after this, Nahash the Ammonite came up and put his forces in position for attacking Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make an agreement with us and we will be your servants.
And Nahash the Ammonite said to them, I will make an agreement with you on this condition, that all your right eyes are put out; so that I may make it a cause of shame to all Israel.
Then the responsible men of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days, so that we may send men to every part of Israel: and then, if no one comes to our help, we will come out to you.
So they sent representatives to Saul's town Gibeah, and these gave the news to the people: and all the people gave themselves to weeping.
Now Saul came from the field, driving the oxen before him; and he said, Why are the people weeping? And they gave him word of what the men of Jabesh had said.
And at their words, the spirit of God came on Saul with power, and he became very angry.
And he took two oxen and , cutting them up , sent them through all the land of Israel by the hand of runners , saying , If any man does not come out after Saul and Samuel , this will be done to his oxen . And the fear
of the Lord came on the people and they came out like one man .
And he had them numbered in Bezek: the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
Then he said to the representatives who had come , Say to the men of Jabesh-gilead , Tomorrow , by the time the sun is high , you will be made safe . And the representatives came and gave the news to the men of Jabesh ; and they were
glad .
So the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you.
Now on the day after , Saul put the people into three bands , and in the morning watch they came to the tents of the Ammonites , and they went on attacking them till the heat of the day : and those who were not put to death were
put to flight in every direction , so that no two of them were together .
And the people said to Samuel, Who was it who said, Is Saul to be our king? give the men up, so that we may put them to death.
And Saul said, Not a man is to be put to death today: for today the Lord has made Israel safe.
Then Samuel said to the people, Come, let us go to Gilgal and there make the kingdom strong in the hands of Saul.
So all the people went to Gilgal; and there in Gilgal they made Saul king before the Lord; and peace-offerings were offered before the Lord; and there Saul and all the men of Israel were glad with great joy.
And Samuel said to all Israel, You see that I have given ear to everything you said to me, and have made a king over you.
And now, see, the king is before you: and I am old and grey-headed, and my sons are with you: I have been living before your eyes from my early days till now.
Here I am : give witness against me before the Lord and before the man on whom he has put the holy oil : whose ox or ass have I taken ? to whom have I been untrue ? who has been crushed down by me ? from whose hand
have I taken a price for the blinding of my eyes ? I will give it all back to you .
And they said, You have never been untrue to us or cruel to us; you have taken nothing from any man.
Then he said, The Lord is witness against you, and the man on whom he has put the holy oil is witness this day that you have seen no wrong in me. And they said, He is witness.
And Samuel said to the people, The Lord is witness, who gave authority to Moses and Aaron, and who took your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
Keep your places now, while I take up the argument with you before the Lord, and give you the story of the righteousness of the Lord, which he has made clear by his acts to you and to your fathers.
When Jacob and his sons had come into Egypt , and were crushed by the Egyptians , the prayers of your fathers came up to the Lord , and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron , who took your fathers out of Egypt , and he put them into this
place .
But they were false to the Lord their God , and he gave them up into the hands of Sisera , captain of the army of Jabin , king of Hazor , and into the hands of the Philistines , and into the hands of the king of Moab ,
who made war against them .
Then crying out to the Lord , they said , We have done evil , because we have been turned away from the Lord , worshipping the Baals and the Astartes : but now , make us safe from those who are against us and we will be your servants
So the Lord sent Jerubbaal and Barak and Jephthah and Samuel and took you out of the power of those who were fighting against you on every side, and made you safe.
And when you saw that Nahash, the king of the Ammonites, was coming against you, you said to me, No more of this; we will have a king for our ruler: when the Lord your God was your king.
Here, then, is the king marked out by you: the Lord has put a king over you.
If in the fear of the Lord you are his servants, hearing his voice and not going against the orders of the Lord, but being true to the Lord your God, you and the king ruling over you, then all will be well:
But if you do not give ear to the voice of the Lord, but go against his orders, then the hand of the Lord will be against you and against your king for your destruction, as it was against your fathers.
Now keep where you are and see this great thing which the Lord will do before your eyes.
Is it not now the time of the grain cutting ? My cry will go up to the Lord and he will send thunder and rain : so that you may see and be conscious of your great sin which you have done in the eyes of the Lord in
desiring a king for yourselves .
So Samuel made prayer to the Lord; and the Lord sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people were in fear of the Lord and of Samuel.
And all the people said to Samuel, Make prayer for us to the Lord your God so that death may not overtake us: for in addition to all our sins we have done this evil, in desiring a king.
Then Samuel said to the people, Have no fear: truly you have done evil, but do not be turned away from the Lord; be his servants with all your heart;
And do not go from the right way turning to those false gods in which there is no profit and no salvation, for they are false.
For the Lord will not give his people up, because of the honour of his name; for it was the Lord's pleasure to make of you a people for himself.
And as for me, never will I go against the orders of the Lord by giving up my prayers for you: but I will go on teaching you the good and right way.
Only go in the fear of the Lord, and be his true servants with all your heart, keeping in mind what great things he has done for you.
But if you still do evil, destruction will overtake you and your king.
***
And Saul took for himself three thousand men of Israel , of whom he kept two thousand with him in Michmash and in the mountain of Beth-el , and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah in the land of Benjamin : the rest of the people he sent back
to their tents .
And Jonathan made an attack on the armed force of the Philistines stationed at Gibeah; and news was given to the Philistines that the Hebrews were turned against them. And Saul had a horn sounded through all the land,
And all Israel had the news that Saul had made an attack on the Philistines, and that Israel was bitterly hated by the Philistines. And the people came together after Saul to Gilgal.
And the Philistines came together to make war on Israel, three thousand war-carriages and six thousand horsemen and an army of people like the sands of the sea in number: they came up and took up their position in Michmash, to the east of Beth-aven.
When the men of Israel saw the danger they were in, (for the people were troubled,) they took cover in cracks in the hillsides and in the woods and in rocks and holes and hollows.
And a great number of the people had gone over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but Saul was still in Gilgal, and all the people went after him shaking in fear.
And he went on waiting there for seven days, the time fixed by Samuel: but Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were starting to go away from him.
Then Saul said, Come here and give me the burned offering and the peace-offerings. And he made a burned offering to the Lord.
And when the burned offering was ended, Samuel came; and Saul went out to see him and to give him a blessing.
And Samuel said, What have you done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were going away from me, and you had not come at the time which had been fixed, and the Philistines had come together at Michmash;
I said, Now the Philistines will come down on me at Gilgal, and I have made no prayer for help to the Lord: and so, forcing myself to do it, I made a burned offering.
And Samuel said to Saul, You have done a foolish thing: you have not kept the rules which the Lord your God gave you; it was the purpose of the Lord to make your authority over Israel safe for ever.
But now , your authority will not go on : the Lord , searching for a man who is pleasing to him in every way , has given him the place of ruler over his people , because you have not done what the Lord gave you orders to do
Then Samuel went up from Gilgal and the rest of the people went up after Saul against the men of war , and they came from Gilgal to Gibeah in the land of Benjamin : and Saul took the number of the people who were with him , about six
hundred men .
And Saul, with Jonathan his son and the people who were with them, was waiting in Geba in the land of Benjamin: but the tents of the Philistines were in Michmash.
And three bands of men came out from the Philistines to make an attack; one band went by the road which goes to Ophrah, into the land of Shual:
And another went in the direction of Beth-horon: and another went by the hill looking down on the valley of Zeboiim, in the direction of the waste land.
Now there was no iron-worker in all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, For fear the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears:
But all the Israelites had to go to the Philistines to get their ploughs and blades and axes and hooks made sharp;
For they had instruments for putting an edge on their ploughs and blades and forks and axes, and for putting iron points on their ox-driving rods.
So on the day of the fight at Michmash, not a sword or a spear was to be seen in the hands of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan: only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.
And the armed force of the Philistines went out to the narrow way of Michmash.
Now one day Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man who was with him, looking after his arms, Come, let us go over to the Philistine force over there. But he said nothing to his father.
And Saul was still waiting in the farthest part of Geba, under the fruit-tree in Migron: there were about six hundred men with him;
And Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, brother of Ichabod, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the Lord in Shiloh, who had the ephod. And the people had no idea that Jonathan had gone.
Now between the narrow roads over the mountains by which Jonathan was making his way to the Philistines' forces, there was a sharp overhanging rock on one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: one was named Bozez and the other Seneh.
The one rock went up on the north in front of Michmash and the other on the south in front of Geba.
And Jonathan said to his young servant who had his arms , Come , let us go over to the armies of these men who have no circumcision : it may be that the Lord will give us help , for there is no limit to his power ; the
Lord is able to give salvation by a great army or by a small band .
And his servant said to him, Do whatever is in your mind: see, I am with you in every impulse of your heart.
Then Jonathan said, Now we will go over to these men and let them see us.
If they say to us, Keep quiet where you are till we come to you; then we will keep our places and not go up to them.
But if they say, Come up to us; then we will go up, for the Lord has given them into our hands: and this will be the sign to us.
And they let the Philistine force see the two of them: and the Philistines said, Look! the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have taken cover.
And the armed men of the force gave Jonathan and his servant their answer , saying , Come up here to us , and we will let you see something . Then Jonathan said to his servant , Come up after me : for the Lord has given them up
into the hands of Israel .
And Jonathan went up, gripping with his hands and his feet, his servant going up after him; and the Philistines gave way before Jonathan when he made an attack on them, and his servant put them to death after him.
And at their first attack, Jonathan and his servant put to the sword about twenty men, all inside the space of half an acre of land.
And there was great fear in the tents and in the field and among all the men of the armed force, and the attackers were shaking with fear; even the earth was moved with a great shaking and there was a fear as from God.
And the watchmen of Saul, looking out from Geba in the land of Benjamin, saw all the army flowing away and running here and there.
Then Saul said to the people who were with him, Let everyone be numbered and let us see who has gone from us. And when they had been numbered, it was seen that Jonathan and his servant were not there.
And Saul said to Ahijah, Let the ephod come here. For he went before Israel with the ephod at that time.
Now while Saul was talking to the priest, the noise in the tents of the Philistines became louder and louder; and Saul said to the priest, Take back your hand.
And Saul and all the people with him came together and went forward to the fight: and every man's sword was turned against the man at his side, and there was a very great noise.
Then the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines for some time, and had gone up with them to their tents, turning round were joined to those who were with Saul and Jonathan.
And all the men of Israel who had taken cover in the hill-country of Ephraim, hearing that the Philistines had been put to flight, went after them, attacking them.
So the Lord made Israel safe that day: and the fight went over to Beth-aven.
And all the people were with Saul , about twenty thousand men , and the fight was general through all the hill-country of Ephraim ; but Saul made a great error that day , by putting the people under an oath , saying , Let that man be cursed who
takes food before evening comes and I have given punishment to those who are against me . So the people had not a taste of food .
And there was honey on the face of the field, and all the people came to the honey, the bees having gone from it;
But not a man put his hand to his mouth for fear of the curse.
But Jonathan, having no knowledge of the oath his father had put on the people, stretching out the rod which was in his hand, put the end of it in the honey, and put it to his mouth; then his eyes were made bright.
Then one of the people said to him, Your father put the people under an oath, saying, Let that man be cursed who takes any food this day. And the people were feeble, needing food.
Then Jonathan said, My father has made trouble come on the land: now see how bright my eyes have become because I have taken a little of this honey.
How much more if the people had freely taken their food from the goods of those who were fighting against them! would there not have been much greater destruction among the Philistines?
That day they overcame the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were feeble from need of food.
And rushing at the goods taken in the fight, the people took oxen and sheep and young oxen, and put them to death there on the earth, and had a meal, taking the flesh with the blood in it.
Then it was said to Saul, See, the people are sinning against the Lord, taking the blood with the flesh. And he said to those who gave him the news, Now let a great stone be rolled to me here.
And Saul said , Go about among the people and say to them , Let every man come here to me with his ox and his sheep , and put them to death here , and take his meal : do no sin against the Lord by taking the blood
with the flesh . So all the people took their oxen with them that night and put them to death there .
And Saul put up an altar to the Lord: this was the first altar which he put up to the Lord.
And Saul said , Let us go down after the Philistines by night , attacking them till the morning , till there is not a man of them living . And they said , Do whatever seems right to you . Then the priest said , Let us come near
to God .
And Saul, desiring directions from God, said, Am I to go down after the Philistines? will you give them up into the hands of Israel? But he gave him no answer that day.
And Saul said, Come near, all you chiefs of the people, and let us get word from God and see in whom is this sin today.
For, by the living Lord, the saviour of Israel, even if the sinner is Jonathan, my son, death will certainly be his fate. But not a man among all the people gave him any answer.
Then he said to all Israel, You be on one side, and I with Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do whatever seems good to you.
Then Saul said to the Lord , the God of Israel , Why have you not given me an answer today ? If the sin is in me or in Jonathan my son , O Lord God of Israel , give Urim , and if it is in your people
Israel , give Thummim . And by the decision of the Lord , Saul and Jonathan were marked out , and the people went free .
And Saul said, Give your decision between my son Jonathan and me. And Jonathan was taken.
Then Saul said to Jonathan, Give me an account of what you have done. And Jonathan gave him the story and said, Certainly I took a little honey on the end of my rod; and now death is to be my fate.
And Saul said, May God's punishment be on me if death is not your fate, Jonathan.
And the people said to Saul , Is death to come to Jonathan , the worker of this great salvation for Israel ? Let it not be so : by the living Lord , not one hair of his head is to be touched , for he has been working
with God today . So the people kept Jonathan from death .
Then Saul, turning back, went after the Philistines no longer: and the Philistines went back to their place.
Now when Saul had taken his place as ruler of Israel, he made war on those who were against him on every side, Moab and the Ammonites and Edom and the kings of Zobah and the Philistines: and whichever way he went, he overcame them.
And he did great things, and overcame the Amalekites, and made Israel safe from the hands of their attackers.
Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan and Ishvi and Malchi-shua; and these are the names of his daughters: the older was named Merab and the younger Michal;
The name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz; the captain of his army was Abner, the son of Ner, brother of Saul's father.
Kish, the father of Saul, and Ner, the father of Abner, were sons of Abiel.
All through the life of Saul there was bitter war against the Philistines; and whenever Saul saw any strong man or any good fighting man, he kept him near himself.
And Samuel said to Saul, The Lord sent me to put the holy oil on you and to make you king over his people, over Israel: so give ear now to the words of the Lord.
The Lord of armies says, I will give punishment to Amalek for what he did to Israel, fighting against him on the way when Israel came out of Egypt.
Go now and put Amalek to the sword, putting to the curse all they have, without mercy: put to death every man and woman, every child and baby at the breast, every ox and sheep, camel and ass.
And Saul sent for the people and had them numbered in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of Judah.
And Saul came to the town of Amalek, and took up his position in the valley secretly.
And Saul said to the Kenites , Go away , take yourselves out from among the Amalekites , or destruction will overtake you with them : for you were kind to the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt . So the Kenites went away from among the
Amalekites .
And Saul made an attack on the Amalekites from Havilah on the road to Shur, which is before Egypt.
He took Agag, king of the Amalekites, prisoner, and put all the people to the sword without mercy.
But Saul and the people did not put Agag to death , and they kept the best of the sheep and the oxen and the fat beasts and the lambs , and whatever was good , not desiring to put them to the curse : but everything which was bad
and of no use they put to the curse .
Then the Lord said to Samuel,
It is no longer my pleasure for Saul to be king; for he is turned back from going in my ways, and has not done my orders. And Samuel was very sad, crying to the Lord in prayer all night.
And early in the morning he got up and went to Saul; and word was given to Samuel that Saul had come to Carmel and put up a pillar, and had gone from there down to Gilgal.
And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, May the blessing of the Lord be with you: I have done what was ordered by the Lord.
And Samuel said, What then is this sound of the crying of sheep and the noise of oxen which comes to my ears?
And Saul said, They have taken them from the Amalekites: for the people have kept the best of the sheep and of the oxen as an offering to the Lord your God; all the rest we have given up to destruction.
Then Samuel said to Saul, Say no more! Let me give you word of what the Lord has said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.
And Samuel said, Though you may seem little to yourself, are you not head of the tribes of Israel? for the Lord with the holy oil made you king over Israel,
And the Lord sent you on a journey and said, Go and put to the curse those sinners, the Amalekites, fighting against them till every one is dead.
Why then did you not do the orders of the Lord, but by violently taking their goods did evil in the eyes of the Lord?
And Saul said, Truly, I have done the orders of the Lord and have gone the way the Lord sent me; I have taken Agag, the king of Amalek, and have given the Amalekites up to destruction.
But the people took some of their goods, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which were put to the curse, to make an offering of them to the Lord your God in Gilgal.
And Samuel said, Has the Lord as much delight in offerings and burned offerings as in the doing of his orders? Truly, to do his pleasure is better than to make offerings, and to give ear to him than the fat of sheep.
For to go against his orders is like the sin of those who make use of secret arts , and pride is like giving worship to images . Because you have put away from you the word of the Lord , he has put you from your place as king
And Saul said to Samuel, Great is my sin: for I have gone against the orders of the Lord and against your words: because, fearing the people, I did what they said.
So now, let my sin have forgiveness, and go back with me to give worship to the Lord.
And Samuel said to Saul, I will not go back with you: for you have put away from you the word of the Lord, and the Lord has put you from your place as king over Israel.
And when Samuel was turning round to go away, Saul took the skirt of his robe in his hand, and the cloth came away.
And Samuel said to him, The Lord has taken away the kingdom of Israel from you this day by force, and has given it to a neighbour of yours who is better than you.
And further, the Glory of Israel will not say what is false, and his purpose may not be changed: for he is not a man, whose purpose may be changed.
Then he said, Great is my sin: but still, give me honour now before the heads of my people and before Israel, and come back with me so that I may give worship to the Lord your God.
So Samuel went back after Saul, and Saul gave worship to the Lord.
Then Samuel said, Make Agag, the king of the Amalekites, come here to me. And Agag came to him shaking with fear. And Agag said, Truly the pain of death is past.
And Samuel said, As your sword has made women without children, so now your mother will be without children among women. And Agag was cut up by Samuel, bone from bone, before the Lord in Gilgal.
Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house in Gibeah, in the land of Saul.
And Samuel never saw Saul again till the day of his death; but Samuel was sorrowing for Saul: and it was no longer the Lord's pleasure for Saul to be king over Israel.
And the Lord said to Samuel , How long will you go on sorrowing for Saul , seeing that I have put him from his place as king over Israel ? Take oil in your vessel and go ; I will send you to Jesse , the Beth-lehemite : for
I have got a king for myself among his sons .
And Samuel said , How is it possible for me to go ? If Saul gets news of it he will put me to death . And the Lord said , Take a young cow with you and say , I have come to make an offering to the Lord
And send for Jesse to be present at the offering, and I will make clear to you what you are to do: and you are to put the holy oil on him whose name I give you.
And Samuel did as the Lord said and came to Beth-lehem. And the responsible men of the town came out to him in fear and said, Do you come in peace?
And he said, In peace: I have come to make an offering to the Lord: make yourselves clean and come with me to make the offering. And he made Jesse and his sons clean, and sent for them to be present at the offering.
Now when they came, looking at Eliab, he said, Clearly the man of the Lord's selection is before him.
But the Lord said to Samuel , Do not take note of his face or how tall he is , because I will not have him : for the Lord ' s view is not man ' s ; man takes note of the outer form , but the Lord
sees the heart .
Then Jesse sent for Abinadab and made him come before Samuel. And he said, The Lord has not taken this one.
Then Jesse made Shammah come before him. And he said, The Lord has not taken this one.
And Jesse made his seven sons come before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, The Lord has not taken any of these.
Then Samuel said to Jesse , Are all your children here ? And he said , There is still the youngest , and he is looking after the sheep . And Samuel said to Jesse , Send and make him come here : for we will not take our seats
till he is here .
So he sent and made him come in. Now he had red hair and beautiful eyes and pleasing looks. And the Lord said, Come, put the oil on him, for this is he.
Then Samuel took the bottle of oil, and put the oil on him there among his brothers: and from that day the spirit of the Lord came on David with power. So Samuel went back to Ramah.
Now the spirit of the Lord had gone from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord was troubling him.
And Saul's servants said to him, See now, an evil spirit from God is troubling you.
Now give orders to your servants who are here before you to go in search of a man who is an expert player on a corded instrument : and it will be that when the evil spirit from God is on you , he will make music for you on
his instrument , and you will get well .
And Saul said to his servants, Then get me a man who is an expert player, and make him come to me.
Then one of the servants in answer said , I have seen a son of Jesse , the Beth-lehemite , who is expert at playing , and a strong man and a man of war ; and he is wise in his words , and pleasing in looks , and
the Lord is with him .
So Saul sent his servants to Jesse and said, Send me your son David who is with the sheep.
And Jesse took five cakes of bread and a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them to Saul by David.
And David came to Saul, waiting before him: and he became very dear to Saul, who made him his servant, giving him the care of his arms.
And Saul sent to Jesse saying, Let David be with me, for he is pleasing to me.
And whenever the evil spirit from God came on Saul, David took his instrument and made music: so new life came to Saul, and he got well, and the evil spirit went away from him.
Now the Philistines got their armies together for war, and came together at Socoh in the land of Judah, and took up their position between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes-dammim.
And Saul and the men of Israel came together and took up their position in the valley of Elah, and put their forces in order against the Philistines.
The Philistines were stationed on the mountain on one side and Israel on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.
And a fighter came out from the tents of the Philistines, named Goliath of Gath; he was more than six cubits tall.
And he had a head-dress of brass on his head, and he was dressed in a coat of metal, the weight of which was five thousand shekels of brass.
His legs were covered with plates of brass and hanging on his back was a javelin of brass.
The stem of his spear was as long as a cloth-worker's rod, and its head was made of six hundred shekels' weight of iron: and one went before him with his body-cover.
He took up his position and in a loud voice said to the armies of Israel , Why have you come out to make war ? Am I not a Philistine and you servants of Saul ? Send out a man for yourselves and let him come down to me
If he is able to have a fight with me and overcome me, then we will be your servants: but if I am able to overcome him, then you will be our servants and do work for us.
And the Philistine said, I have put to shame the armies of Israel this day; give me a man so that we may have a fight together.
And Saul and all Israel, hearing those words of the Philistine, were troubled and full of fear.
Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah named Jesse, who had eight sons; and he was an old man in Saul's day, and far on in years.
And the three oldest sons of Jesse had gone with Saul to the fight: the names of the three who went to the fight were Eliab, the oldest, and Abinadab the second, and Shammah the third.
And David was the youngest: and the three oldest were with Saul's army.
Now David went to and from Saul, looking after his father's sheep at Beth-lehem.
And the Philistine came near every morning and evening for forty days.
And Jesse said to his son David, Take now for your brothers an ephah of this dry grain and these ten cakes of bread, and go quickly with them to the tents to your brothers;
And take these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and see how your brothers are and come back with a sign to say how they are.
Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
And David got up early in the morning , and , giving the sheep into the care of a keeper , took the things and went as Jesse had said ; and he came to the lines where the carts were , when the army was going out to the
fight giving their war-cry .
And Israel and the Philistines had put their forces in position, army against army.
And David gave his parcels into the hands of the keeper of the army stores, and went running to the army and came to his brothers to get knowledge about them.
And while he was talking to them, the fighter, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came out from the Philistines' lines and said the same words, in David's hearing.
And all the men of Israel, when they saw him, went in flight, overcome with fear.
And the men of Israel said , Have you seen this man ? Clearly he has come out to put shame on Israel : and it is certain that if any man overcomes him , the king will give that man great wealth , and will give him his daughter
, and make his father ' s family free in Israel .
And David said to the men near him , What will be done to the man who overcomes this Philistine and takes away the shame from Israel ? for who is this Philistine , a man without circumcision , that he has put shame on the armies of the living
God ?
And the people gave him this answer, So it will be done to the man who overcomes him.
And Eliab , his oldest brother , hearing what David said to the men , was moved to wrath against David , and said , Why have you come here ? Into whose care have you given that little flock of sheep in the waste land ? I have knowledge
of your pride and the evil of your heart , you have come down to see the fight .
And David said, What have I done now? was it not only a word?
And turning away from him to one of the other men, he said the same words: and the people gave him the same answer.
And, hearing what David said, they gave Saul word of it: and he sent for him.
And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart become feeble because of him; I, your servant, will go out and have a fight with this Philistine.
And Saul said to David, You are not able to go out against this Philistine and have a fight with him: for you are only a boy, and he has been a man of war from his earliest days.
And David said to Saul, Your servant has been keeper of his father's sheep; and if a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock,
I went out after him, and overcame him, and took it out of his mouth: and if, turning on me, he came at me, I took him by the hair and overcame him and put him to death.
Your servant has overcome lion and bear: and the fate of this Philistine, who is without circumcision, will be like theirs, seeing that he has put shame on the armies of the living God.
And David said, The Lord, who kept me safe from the grip of the lion and the bear, will be my saviour from the hands of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go! and may the Lord be with you.
Then Saul gave David his clothing of war, and put a head-dress of brass on his head and had him clothed with a coat of metal.
And David took Saul ' s sword and put the band round him over the metal coat , and was unable to go forward ; for he was not used to them . Then David said to Saul , It is not possible for me to go out with these
, for I am not used to them . So David took them off .
Then he took his stick in his hand , and got five smooth stones from the bed of the stream and put them in a bag such as is used by sheep-keepers ; and in his hand was a leather band used for sending stones : and so he went
in the direction of the Philistine .
And the Philistine came nearer to David; and the man who had his body-cover went before him.
And when the Philistine, taking note, saw David, he had a poor opinion of him: for he was only a boy, red-haired and good-looking.
And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come out to me with sticks? And the Philistine put curses on David by all his gods.
And the Philistine said to David, Come here to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field.
Then David said to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword and a spear and a javelin: but I come to you in the name of the Lord of armies, the God of the armies of Israel on which you have put shame.
This day the Lord will give you up into my hands , and I will overcome you , and take your head off you ; and I will give the bodies of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth today , so
that all the earth may see that Israel has a God ;
And all these people who are here today may see that the Lord does not give salvation by sword and spear: for the fight is the Lord's, and he will give you up into our hands.
Now when the Philistine made a move and came near to David, David quickly went at a run in the direction of the army, meeting the Philistine face to face.
And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and sent it from his leather band straight at the Philistine, and the stone went deep into his brow, and he went down to the earth, falling on his face.
So David overcame the Philistine with his leather band and a stone, wounding the Philistine and causing his death: but David had no sword in his hand.
So running up to the Philistine and putting his foot on him , David took his sword out of its cover , and put him to death , cutting off his head with it . And when the Philistines saw that their fighter was dead , they went in flight
And the men of Israel and of Judah got up , and gave a cry , and went after the Philistines as far as Gath and the town doors of Ekron . And the wounded of the Philistines were falling down by the road from Shaaraim all the way to
Gath and Ekron .
Then the children of Israel came back from going after the Philistines, and took their goods from the tents.
And David took the head of the Philistine to Jerusalem, but the metal war-dress and the arms he put in his tent.
And when Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the army, Abner, whose son is this young man? And Abner said, On your life, O king, I have no idea.
And the king said, Make search and see whose son this young man is.
And when David was coming back after the destruction of the Philistine, Abner took him to Saul, with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
And Saul said to him, Young man, whose son are you? And David in answer said, I am the son of your servant Jesse of Beth-lehem.
Now after David's talk with Saul was ended, the soul of Jonathan was joined with the soul of David, and David became as dear to him as his very life.
And that day Saul took David and would not let him go back to his father's house.
Then Jonathan and David made an agreement together, because of Jonathan's love for David.
And Jonathan took off the robe he had on and gave it to David, with all his military dress, even to his sword and his bow and the band round his body.
And David went wherever Saul sent him, and did wisely: and Saul put him at the head of his men of war, and this was pleasing to all the people as well as to Saul's servants.
Now on their way, when David came back after the destruction of the Philistine, the women came out of all the towns of Israel, with songs and dances, meeting David with melody and joy and instruments of music.
And the women, answering one another in their song, said, Saul has put to death his thousands and David his tens of thousands.
And Saul was very angry and this saying was unpleasing to him; and he said, They have given David credit for tens of thousands, and to me for only thousands: what more is there for him but the kingdom?
And from that day Saul was looking with envy on David.
Now on the day after , an evil spirit from God came on Saul with great force and he was acting like a prophet among the men of his house , while David was making music for him , as he did day by day : and Saul had his
spear in his hand .
And Saul, balancing the spear in his hand, said, I will give David a blow, pinning him to the wall. And David got away from him twice.
And Saul went in fear of David, because the Lord was with David and had gone away from Saul.
So Saul sent him away, and made him a captain over a thousand; and he went about his business before the people.
And in all his undertakings David did wisely; and the Lord was with him.
And when Saul saw how wisely he did, he was in fear of him.
But David was loved by all Israel and Judah, for he went out and came in before them.
And Saul said to David , Here is my oldest daughter Merab , whom I will give you for your wife : only be strong for me , fighting in the Lord ' s wars . For Saul said , Let it not be through me that his fate comes
to him , but through the Philistines .
And David said to Saul, Who am I, and what is my father's family in Israel, that I am to be son-in-law to the king?
But when the time came to give Merab, Saul's daughter, to David, she was given to Adriel of Meholath.
And Saul's daughter Michal was in love with David: and Saul had word of it and was pleased.
And Saul said , I will give her to him , so that she may be a cause of danger to him , and so that the hands of the Philistines may be against him . So Saul said to David , Today you are to become my son-in-law for
the second time .
And Saul gave his servants orders saying, Have talk with David secretly and say to him, See how the king has delight in you, and how you are loved by all his servants: then be the king's son-in-law.
And Saul's servants said these things to David. And David said, Does it seem to you a small thing to be the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, of no great name?
And the servants of Saul gave him an account of what David had said.
And Saul said , Then say to David , The king has no desire for any bride-price , but only for the private parts of a hundred Philistines so that the king may get the better of his haters . But it was in Saul ' s mind that David
might come to his end by the hands of the Philistines .
And when his servants said these words to David, he was well pleased to be the son-in-law of the king. And the days were still not past.
So David and his men got up and went , and put to death two hundred of the Philistines ; and David took their private parts and gave the full number of them to the king , so that he might be the king ' s son-in-law . And Saul
gave him his daughter Michal for his wife .
And it was clear to Saul that the Lord was with David; and he was loved by all Israel.
And Saul's fear of David became all the greater, and he went on hating him, day by day.
Then the rulers of the Philistines went out to war: and whenever they went out, David did more wisely than all the other servants of Saul, so that his name became greatly honoured.
And Saul gave orders to his son Jonathan and to all his servants to put David to death. But Saul's son Jonathan had great delight in David.
And Jonathan said to David, Saul, my father, is purposing your death: so now, take care in the morning, and keep yourself safe in a secret place:
And I will go out and take my place by my father's side in the field near where you are; and I will get into talk with my father about you, and when I see how things are, I will give you word.
And Jonathan gave his father Saul a good account of David, and said to him, Let not the king do wrong against his servant, against David; because he has done you no wrong, and all his acts have had a good outcome for you:
For he put his life in danger and overcame the Philistine, and the Lord gave all Israel salvation: you saw it and were glad: why then are you sinning against him who has done no wrong, desiring the death of David without cause?
And Saul gave ear to the voice of Jonathan, and said with an oath, By the living Lord, he is not to be put to death.
Then Jonathan sent for David and gave him word of all these things. And Jonathan took David to Saul, who kept him by his side as in the past.
And there was war again: and David went out fighting the Philistines, causing great destruction among them; and they went in flight before him.
And an evil spirit from the Lord came on Saul, when he was seated in his house with his spear in his hand; and David made music for him.
And Saul would have sent his spear through him, pinning him to the wall, but he got away and the spear went into the wall: and that night David went in flight and got away.
Then in that night Saul sent men to David ' s house to keep watch on him so as to put him to death in the morning : and David ' s wife Michal said to him , If you do not go away to a safe place tonight you
will be put to death in the morning .
So Michal let David down through the window, and he went in flight and got away.
Then Michal took the image and put it in the bed, with a cushion of goat's hair at its head, and she put clothing over it.
And when Saul sent men to take David, she said, He is ill.
And Saul sent his men to see David, saying, Do not come back without him, take him in his bed, so that I may put him to death.
And when the men came in, there was the image in the bed, with the cushion of goat's hair at its head
And Saul said to Michal, why have you been false to me, letting my hater go and get safely away? And in answer Michal said to Saul, He said to me, Let me go, or I will put you to death.
So David went in flight and got away and came to Ramah, to Samuel, and gave him an account of all Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and were living in Naioth.
And word was given to Saul that David was at Naioth in Ramah.
And Saul sent men to take David; and when they saw the band of prophets at work, with Samuel in his place at their head, the spirit of God came on Saul's men, and they became like prophets.
And Saul, having news of this, sent other men, who in the same way became like prophets. And a third time Saul sent men, and they like the others became like prophets.
Then he himself went to Ramah, and came to the great water-spring in Secu; and questioning the people he said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, They are at Naioth in Ramah.
And he went on from there to Naioth in Ramah: and the spirit of God came on him, and he went on, acting like a prophet, till he came to Naioth in Ramah.
And he took off his clothing, acting like a prophet before Samuel, and falling down he was stretched out, without his clothing, all that day and all that night. This is the reason for the saying, Is even Saul among the prophets?
And Hannah, in prayer before the Lord, said, My heart is glad in the Lord, my horn is lifted up in the Lord: my mouth is open wide over my haters; because my joy is in your salvation.
No other is holy as the Lord, for there is no other God but you: there is no Rock like our God.
Say no more words of pride; let not uncontrolled sayings come out of your mouths: for the Lord is a God of knowledge, by him acts are judged.
The bows of the men of war are broken, and the feeble are clothed with strength.
Those who were full are offering themselves as servants for bread; those who were in need are at rest; truly, she who had no children has become the mother of seven; and she who had a family is wasted with sorrow.
The Lord is the giver of death and life: sending men down to the underworld and lifting them up.
The Lord gives wealth and takes a man's goods from him: crushing men down and again lifting them up;
Lifting the poor out of the dust , and him who is in need out of the lowest place , to give them their place among rulers , and for their heritage the seat of glory : for the pillars of the earth are the Lord ' s and he
has made them the base of the world .
He will keep the feet of his holy ones, but the evil-doers will come to their end in the dark night, for by strength no man will overcome.
Those who make war against the Lord will be broken ; against them he will send his thunder from heaven : the Lord will be judge of the ends of the earth , he will give strength to his king , lifting up the horn of him on whom the
holy oil has been put .
Then Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child became the servant of the Lord under the direction of Eli the priest.
Now the sons of Eli were evil and good-for-nothing men, having no knowledge of the Lord.
And the priests' way with the people was this: when any man made an offering, the priest's servant came while the flesh was being cooked, having in his hand a meat-hook with three teeth;
This he put into the pot, and everything which came up on the hook the priest took for himself. This they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.
And more than this , before the fat was burned , the priest ' s servant would come and say to the man who was making the offering , Give me some of the flesh to be cooked for the priest ; he has no taste for meat cooked in
water , but would have you give it uncooked .
And if the man said to him, First let the fat be burned, then take as much as you will; then the servant would say, No, you are to give it to me now, or I will take it by force.
And the sin of these young men was very great before the Lord; for they gave no honour to the Lord's offerings.
But Samuel did the work of the Lord's house, while he was a child, dressed in a linen ephod.
And his mother made him a little robe and took it to him every year when she came with her husband for the year's offering.
And every year Eli gave Elkanah and his wife a blessing, saying, May the Lord give you offspring by this woman in exchange for the child you have given to the Lord. And they went back to their house.
And the Lord had mercy on Hannah and she gave birth to three sons and two daughters. And the young Samuel became older before the Lord.
Now Eli was very old; and he had news from time to time of what his sons were doing to all Israel.
And he said to them, Why are you doing such things? for from all this people I get accounts of your evil ways.
No, my sons, the account which is given me, which the Lord's people are sending about, is not good.
If one man does wrong to another , God will be his judge : but if a man ' s sin is against the Lord , who will take up his cause ? But they gave no attention to the voice of their father , for it was the Lord
' s purpose to send destruction on them .
And the young Samuel, becoming older, had the approval of the Lord and of men.
And a man of God came to Eli and said to him, The Lord says, Did I let myself be seen by your father's people when they were in Egypt, servants in Pharaoh's house?
Did I take him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest and to go up to my altar to make the smoke of the offerings go up and to take up the ephod ? Did I give to your father ' s family all the offerings
made by fire by the children of Israel ?
Why then are you looking with envy on my offerings of meat and of meal which were ordered by my word, honouring your sons before me, and making yourselves fat with all the best of the offerings of Israel, my people?
For this reason the Lord God of Israel has said , Truly I did say that your family and your father ' s people would have their place before me for ever : but now the Lord says , Let it not be so ; I will give honour to
those by whom I am honoured , and those who have no respect for me will be of small value in my eyes .
See, the days are coming when your arm and the arm of your father's people will be cut off;
And never again will there be an old man in your family.
But one man of your family will not be cut off by my hand, and his eyes will be made dark, and grief will be in his heart: and all the offspring of your family will come to their end by the sword of men.
And this will be the sign to you, which will come on Hophni and Phinehas, your sons; death will overtake them on the same day.
And I will make a true priest for myself , one who will do what is in my heart and in my mind : and I will make for him a family which will not come to an end ; and his place will be before my holy one for
ever .
Then it will be that the rest of your family , anyone who has not been cut off , will go down on his knees to him for a bit of silver or a bit of bread , and say , Be pleased to put me into one of the
priest ' s places so that I may have a little food .
And David went in flight from Naioth in Ramah and came to Jonathan and said, What have I done? What is my crime and my sin against your father that he is attempting to take my life?
And he said to him, Far be the thought: you will not be put to death: see, my father does nothing, great or small, without giving me word of it: would he keep this secret from me? It is not so.
But David took his oath again and said , Your father sees that I am dear to you ; so he says to himself , Let Jonathan have no idea of this , for it will be a grief to him ; but as the Lord is living , and
as your soul is living , there is only a step between me and death .
Then Jonathan said to David, Whatever your desire is, I will do it for you.
And David said to Jonathan, Tomorrow is the new moon, and I will not be seated with the king at his table: but let me go to a safe place in the country till the evening.
And if your father takes note of the fact that I am away, say, David made a request to me for himself that he might go to Beth-lehem, to his town: for it is the time when his family make their offering year by year.
If he says, It is well, your servant will be at peace: but if he is angry, then it will be clear to you that he has an evil purpose in mind against me.
So, then, be kind to your servant; for you have been united with your servant in an agreement made before the Lord: but if there is any wrongdoing in me, put me to death yourself; why take me to your father?
And Jonathan said, Do not have such a thought: for if I saw that my father was designing evil against you, would I not give you word of it?
Then David said to Jonathan, Who will give me word if your father gives you a rough answer?
And Jonathan said to David, Come, let us go out into the country. And the two of them went out together into the open country.
And Jonathan said to David , May the Lord , the God of Israel , be witness ; when I have had a chance of talking to my father , about this time tomorrow , if his feelings to David are good , will I not send and give you
the news ?
May the Lord ' s punishment be on Jonathan , if it is my father ' s pleasure to do you evil and I do not give you word of it and send you away so that you may go in peace : and may the Lord be with you
, as he has been with my father .
And may you, while I am still living, O may you be kind to me, as the Lord is kind, and keep me from death!
And let not your mercy ever be cut off from my family, even when the Lord has sent destruction on all David's haters, cutting them off from the face of the earth.
And if it comes about that the name of Jonathan is cut off from the family of David, the Lord will make David responsible.
And Jonathan again took an oath to David, because of his love for him: for David was as dear to him as his very soul.
Then Jonathan said to him, Tomorrow is the new moon: and it will be seen that you are not present, for there will be no one in your seat.
And on the third day it will be specially noted, and you will go to the place where you took cover when the other business was in hand, waiting by the hill over there.
And on the third day I will send arrows from my bow against its side as if at a mark.
And I will send my boy to have a look for the arrow . And if I say to him , See , the arrow is on this side of you ; take it up ! then you may come ; for there is peace for you and no evil
, by the living Lord .
But if I say to the boy, See, the arrow has gone past you: then go on your way, for the Lord has sent you away.
As for what you and I were talking of, the Lord is between you and me for ever.
So David went to a secret place in the country: and when the new moon came, the king took his place at the feast.
And the king took his seat, as at other times, by the wall: and Jonathan was in front, and Abner was seated by Saul's side, but there was no one in David's seat.
But Saul said nothing that day, for his thought was, Something has taken place making him unclean; it is clear that he is not clean.
And on the day after the new moon, that is, the second day, there was still no one in David's seat: and Saul said to his son Jonathan, Why has the son of Jesse not come to the feast yesterday or today?
And answering Saul, Jonathan said, He made a request to me that he might go to Beth-lehem,
Saying , Our family is making an offering in the town , and my brothers have given me orders to be there : so now , if I have grace in your eyes , let me go away and see my brothers . This is why he has not come
to the king ' s table .
Then Saul was moved to wrath against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of an evil and uncontrolled woman, have I not seen how you have given your love to the son of Jesse, to your shame and the shame of your mother?
For while the son of Jesse is living on the earth, your position is unsafe and your kingdom is in danger. So make him come here to me, for it is certainly right for him to be put to death.
And Jonathan, answering his father Saul, said to him, Why is he to be put to death? What has he done?
And Saul, pointing his spear at him, made an attempt to give him a wound: from which it was clear to Jonathan that his father's purpose was to put David to death.
So Jonathan got up from the table, burning with wrath, and took no part in the feast the second day of the month, being full of grief for David because his father had put shame on him.
Now in the morning, Jonathan went out into the fields at the time he had said to David, and he had a little boy with him.
And he said to the boy, Go and get the arrow I let loose from my bow. And while the boy was running, he sent an arrow past him.
And when the boy came to the place where the arrow was, Jonathan, crying out after the boy, said, Has it not gone past you?
And Jonathan went on crying out after the boy, Be quick, do not keep waiting about, go quickly. And Jonathan's boy got the arrow and came back to his master.
But the boy had no idea what was going on; only Jonathan and David had knowledge of it.
And Jonathan gave his bow and arrows to the boy, and said to him, Take these and go back to the town.
And when the boy had gone, David came from his secret place by the hill, and falling to the earth went down on his face three times: and they gave one another a kiss, weeping together, till David's grief was the greater.
And Jonathan said to David , Go in peace , for we two have taken an oath , in the name of the Lord , saying , The Lord will be between me and you , and between my seed and your seed for ever . Then David went away
, and Jonathan went into the town .
Then David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was full of fear at meeting David, and said to him, Why are you by yourself, having no man with you?
And David said to Ahimelech the priest , The king has given me orders and has said to me , Say nothing to anyone about the business on which I am sending you and the orders I have given you : and a certain place has been fixed to which
the young men are to go .
So now, if you have here five cakes of bread, give them into my hand, or whatever you have.
And the priest, answering David, said, I have no common bread here but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.
And David in answer said to the priest , Certainly women have been kept from us ; and as has been done before when I have gone out the arms of the young men were made holy , even though it was a common journey ; how much more today
will their arms be made holy .
So the priest gave him the holy bread: there was no other, only the holy bread which had been taken from before the Lord, so that new bread might be put in its place on the day when it was taken away.
Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, kept back before the Lord; his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the strongest of Saul's runners.
And David said to Ahimelech, Have you no sword or spear with you here? for I have come without my sword and other arms, because the king's business had to be done quickly.
And the priest said , The sword of Goliath the Philistine , whom you put to death in the valley of Elah , is here folded in a cloth at the back of the ephod : take that , if you will , for there is no other sword here
. And David said , there is no other sword like that ; give it to me .
Then David got up and went in flight that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish, the king of Gath.
And the servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David, the king of the land? did they not make songs about him in their dances, saying, Saul has put to death thousands, and David tens of thousands?
And David took these words to heart, fearing Achish, the king of Gath.
So changing his behaviour before them, he made it seem as if he was off his head, hammering on the doors of the town, and letting the water from his mouth go down his chin.
Then Achish said to his servants, Look! the man is clearly off his head; why have you let him come before me?
Are there not enough unbalanced men about me, that you have let this person come and do such tricks before me? is such a man to come into my house?
So David went away from there and took cover in a strong place at Adullam; and his brothers and all his father's people, hearing of it, went down to him there.
And everyone who was in trouble, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was bitter in soul, came together to him, and he became captain over them: about four hundred men were joined to him.
And from there David went to Mizpeh in the land of Moab: and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father and mother come and make their living-place with you till it is clear to me what God will do for me.
And he took them to the king of Moab and they went on living with him while David was in his safe place.
And the prophet Gad said to David, Do not go on living in this place but go into the land of Judah. Then David went away and came to the woodland of Hereth.
And news was given to Saul that David had been seen , and the men who were with him : now Saul was in Gibeah , seated under the tree in the high place , with his spear in his hand , and all his servants were in their places
before him .
Then Saul said to his servants who were there about him, Give ear now, you Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give to every one of you fields and vine-gardens, will he make you all captains of hundreds and captains of thousands;
That all of you have made designs against me , and not one of you gave me word when my son made an agreement with the son of Jesse , and not one of you has pity for me or has made my eyes open to the fact that my
servant has been moved by my son against me , as at this day ?
Then Doeg, the Edomite, who was by the side of the servants of Saul, in answer said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub.
And he got directions from the Lord for him, and gave him food, and put in his hand the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
Then the king sent for Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and for all the men of his father's family who were priests in Nob: and they all came to the king.
And Saul said, Give ear now, O son of Ahitub. And answering he said, Here I am, my lord.
And Saul said to him , Why have you made designs against me with the son of Jesse , giving him food and a sword and getting directions from the Lord for him , and helping him to take up arms against me , and to be on the watch
to make a secret attack on me as he is doing now ?
Then Ahimelech answering said to the king, Who among all your servants is so true to you as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and is a captain of your armed men, and has a place of honour in your house?
Is this the first time I have got directions from God for him ? Far be the thought ! let the king make no such statement against his servant or my father ' s family , for your servant has no knowledge , great or small , of this thing
And the king said, You will certainly be put to death, Ahimelech, you and all your father's family.
Then the king said to the runners who were waiting near him , Put the priests of the Lord to death ; because they are on David ' s side , and having knowledge of his flight , did not give me word of it . But the king '
s servants would not put out their hands to make an attack on the Lord ' s priests .
Then the king said to Doeg, You are to put the priests to death. And Doeg the Edomite, turning on the priests and attacking them, put to death that day eighty-five men who took up the ephod.
And Nob, the town of the priests, he put to the sword, all the men and women, children and babies at the breast, and oxen and asses and sheep.
And Abiathar, one of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, got away and went in flight after David;
And gave him the news of how Saul had put to death the Lord's priests.
And David said to Abiathar, I was certain that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would take the news to Saul: I am responsible for the lives of all your father's family.
Keep here with me and have no fear; for he who has designs on my life has designs on yours: but with me you will be safe.
And they sent word to David, saying, The Philistines are fighting against Keilah and taking the grain from the grain-floors.
So David, questioning the Lord, said, Am I to go and make an attack on these Philistines? And the Lord said to David, Go and make an attack on the Philistines so that Keilah may be kept from falling into their hands.
And David's men said to him, Even here in Judah we are full of fear: how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
Then David put the question to the Lord again, and the Lord answering said, Up! go down to Keilah; for I will give the Philistines into your hands.
So David and his men went to Keilah, and had a fight with the Philistines, and took away their cattle, and put them to the sword with great destruction. So David was the saviour of the people of Keilah.
Now when Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, went in flight to David, he came down to Keilah with the ephod in his hand.
And news was given to Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, Now God has given him into my hands; for by going into a walled town with locked doors, he has let himself be shut in.
And Saul sent for all the people to come to the fight, and go down to Keilah to make an attack on David and his men.
And it was clear to David that Saul had evil designs against him, and he said to Abiathar the priest, Come here with the ephod.
Then David said, O Lord, the God of Israel, news has been given to your servant that it is Saul's purpose to come to Keilah and send destruction on the town because of me.
And now , is it true , as they have said to me , that Saul is coming ? O Lord , the God of Israel , give ear to your servant , and say if these things are so . And the Lord said , He is coming down
Then David said, Will the men of Keilah give me and my men up to Saul? and the Lord said, They will give you up.
Then David and his men, about six hundred of them, went out of Keilah, and got away wherever they were able to go. And Saul, hearing that David had got away from Keilah, did not go there.
And David kept in the waste land, in safe places, waiting in the hill-country in the waste land of Ziph. And Saul was searching for him every day, but God did not give him up into his hands.
And David was full of fear, in the knowledge that Saul had come out to take his life; and David was in the waste land of Ziph, in Horesh.
And Saul's son Jonathan went to David in Horesh, and made his hands strong in God;
And said to him, Have no fear, for Saul my father will not get you into his power; and you will be king of Israel, and I will be by your side, and my father Saul is certain of this.
And the two of them made an agreement before the Lord: and David went on living in Horesh, and Jonathan went back to his house.
Then the Ziphites came up to Gibeah to see Saul, and said, Is not David living secretly among us in the strong places in Horesh, in the hill of Hachilah to the south of the waste land?
So now, O king, have your soul's desire and come down, and we, for our part, will give him up into the king's hands.
And Saul said, The Lord's blessing will be yours, for you have had pity on me.
Go now, and take more steps, and see where he is living: for they say that he is expert in deceit.
So take care to get knowledge of all the secret places where he is taking cover , and be certain to come back to me , and I will go with you : and without doubt , if he is anywhere in the land , I will get him ,
among all the families of Judah .
And they went back and came to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the waste land of Maon, in the dry land south of the waste land.
And Saul and his men went in search of him. And David had word of it, so he came down to the rock in the waste land of Maon. And Saul, hearing of this, went after David into the waste land of Maon.
And Saul and his men went on one side of the mountain , and David and his men went on the other : and David ' s purpose was to get away as quickly as possible , for fear of Saul ; for Saul and his men were making a
circle round David and his men in order to take them .
But a man came to Saul saying, Be quick and come; for the Philistines have made an attack on the land.
So turning back from going after David, Saul went against the Philistines: so that place was named Sela-hammah-lekoth.
And from there, David went up and took cover in the safe place of En-gedi.
Now when Saul came back from fighting the Philistines, news was given him that David was in the waste land of En-gedi.
Then Saul took three thousand of the best men out of all Israel, and went in search of David and his men on the rocks of the mountain goats.
And on the way he came to a place where sheep were kept, where there was a hollow in the rock; and Saul went in for a private purpose. Now David and his men were in the deepest part of the hollow.
And David ' s men said to him , Now is the time when the Lord says to you , I will give up your hater into your hands to do with him whatever seems good to you . Then David , getting up , took the skirt of Saul
' s robe in his hand , cutting off the end of it without his knowledge .
And later, David was full of regret for cutting off Saul's skirt.
And David said to his men, Before the Lord, never let it be said that my hand was lifted up against my lord, the man of the Lord's selection, for the Lord's holy oil has been put on him.
So with these words David kept his servants back, and did not let them make an attack on Saul. And Saul got up and went on his way.
And after that David came out of the hollow rock, and crying after Saul said, My lord the king. And when Saul gave a look back, David went down on his face and gave him honour.
And David said to Saul, Why do you give any attention to those who say that it is my desire to do you wrong?
Look ! you have seen today how the Lord gave you up into my hands even now in the hollow of the rocks : and some would have had me put you to death , but I had pity on you : for I said , Never will my hand
be lifted up against my lord , who has been marked with the holy oil .
And see , my father , see the skirt of your robe in my hand : for the fact that I took off the skirt of your robe and did not put you to death is witness that I have no evil purpose , and I have done you no
wrong , though you are waiting for my life to take it .
May the Lord be judge between me and you, and may the Lord give me my rights against you, but my hand will never be lifted up against you.
There is an old saying, From the evil-doer comes evil: but my hand will never be lifted up against you.
After whom has the king of Israel come out? for whom are you searching? for a dead dog, an insect.
So let the Lord be judge, and give a decision between me and you, and see and give support to my cause, and keep me from falling into your hands.
Now when David had said these words to Saul, Saul said, Is this your voice, David, my son? And Saul was overcome with weeping.
And he said to David, You are right and I am wrong: for you have given me back good, but I have given you evil.
And you have made clear to me how good you have been to me today: because, when the Lord gave me up into your hands, you did not put me to death.
If a man comes across his hater, will he let him get away safe? so may you be rewarded by the Lord for what you have done for me today.
And now I am certain that you will be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be made strong under your authority.
So give me your oath by the Lord, that you will not put an end to my seed after me or let my name be cut off from my father's family.
And David gave Saul his oath. And Saul went back to his house; but David and his men went up to their safe place.
And death came to Samuel; and all Israel came together, weeping for him, and put his body in its resting-place in his house at Ramah. Then David went down to the waste land of Maon.
Now there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel; he was a great man and had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats: and he was cutting the wool of his sheep in Carmel.
Now this man was named Nabal, and his wife's name was Abigail: she was a woman of good sense and pleasing looks: but the man was cruel and evil in his ways; he was of the family of Caleb.
And David had word in the waste land that Nabal was cutting the wool of his sheep.
And David sent ten young men, and said to them, Go up to Carmel and go to Nabal, and say kind words to him in my name;
And say this to my brother, May all be well for you: peace be to you and your house and all you have.
I have had word that you have wool-cutters: now the keepers of your sheep have been with us, and we have done them no evil, and taken nothing of theirs while they were in Carmel.
If your young men are questioned they will say the same thing . So now , let my young men have grace in your eyes , for we are come at a good time ; please give anything you may have by you to your servants and to your son
David .
And when David's young men came, they said all this to Nabal, in David's name, and said nothing more.
And Nabal gave them his answer and said, Who is David? who is the son of Jesse? there are a number of servants in these days running away from their masters.
Am I to take my bread and my wine and the meat I have got ready for my wool-cutters and give it to men coming from I have no idea where?
So David's young men, turning away, went back and gave him an account of everything he had said.
And David said to his men, Put on your swords, every one of you. And every man put on his sword; and David did the same; and about four hundred men went up with David, and two hundred kept watch over their goods.
But one of the young men said to Nabal's wife Abigail, David sent men from the waste land to say kind words to our master, and he gave them a rough answer.
But these men have been very good to us; they did us no wrong and nothing of ours was touched while we were with them in the fields:
But day and night they were like a wall round us while we were with them, looking after the sheep.
So now, give thought to what you are going to do; for evil is in store for our master and all his house: for he is such a good-for-nothing person that it is not possible to say anything to him.
Then Abigail quickly took two hundred cakes of bread and two skins full of wine and five sheep ready for cooking and five measures of dry grain and a hundred parcels of dry grapes and two hundred cakes of figs, and put them on asses.
And she said to her young men, Go on in front of me and I will come after you. But she said nothing to her husband Nabal.
Now while she was going down under cover of the mountain on her ass, David and his men came down against her, and suddenly she came face to face with them.
Now David had said, What was the use of my taking care of this man's goods in the waste land, so that there was no loss of anything which was his? he has only given me back evil for good.
May God's punishment be on David, if when morning comes there is so much as one male of his people still living.
And when Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her ass, falling down on her face before him.
And falling at his feet she said, May the wrong be on me, my lord, on me: let your servant say a word to you, and give ear to the words of your servant.
Let my lord give no attention to Nabal, that good-for-nothing: for as his name is, so is he, a man without sense: but I, your servant, did not see the young men whom my lord sent.
So now , my lord , by the living God and by your living soul , seeing that the Lord has kept you from the crime of blood and from taking into your hands the punishment for your wrongs , may all your haters , and those who would do
evil to my lord , be like Nabal .
And let this offering, which your servant gives to my lord, be given to the young men who are with my lord.
And may the sin of your servant have forgiveness: for the Lord will certainly make your family strong, because my lord is fighting in the Lord's war; and no evil will be seen in you all your days.
And though a man has taken up arms against you , putting your life in danger , still the soul of my lord will be kept safe among the band of the living with the Lord your God ; and the souls of those who are against you he will
send violently away from him , like stones from a bag .
And when the Lord has done for my lord all those good things which he has said he will do for you, and has made you a ruler over Israel;
Then you will have no cause for grief , and my lord ' s heart will not be troubled because you have taken life without cause and have yourself given punishment for your wrongs : and when the Lord has been good to you , then give a thought to
your servant .
And David said to Abigail, May the Lord, the God of Israel, be praised, who sent you to me today:
A blessing on your good sense and on you, who have kept me today from the crime of blood and from taking into my hands the punishment for my wrongs.
For truly , by the living Lord , the God of Israel , who has kept me from doing you evil , if you had not been so quick in coming to me and meeting me , by dawn there would not have been in Nabal ' s house so
much as one male living .
Then David took from her hands her offering: and he said to her, Go back to your house in peace; see, I have given ear to your voice, and taken your offering with respect.
And Abigail went back to Nabal; and he was feasting in his house like a king; and Nabal's heart was full of joy, for he had taken much wine; so she said nothing to him till dawn came.
And in the morning, when the effect of the wine was gone, Nabal's wife gave him an account of all these things, and all the heart went out of him, and he became like stone.
And about ten days after, the Lord sent disease on Nabal and death came to him.
And David , hearing that Nabal was dead , said , May the Lord be praised , who has taken up my cause against Nabal for the shame which he put on me , and has kept back his servant from evil , and has sent on Nabal ' s
head the reward of his evil-doing . And David sent word to Abigail , desiring to take her as his wife .
And when David's servants came to Carmel, to Abigail, they said to her, David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife.
And she got up, and going down on her face to the earth, said, See, I am ready to be a servant-girl, washing the feet of the servants of my lord.
Then Abigail got up quickly and went on her ass, with five of her young women, after the men whom David had sent; and she became David's wife.
And David had taken Ahinoam of Jezreel, to be his wife; these two were his wives.
Now Saul had given his daughter Michal, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish of Gallim.
And the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, and said, Is not David waiting secretly near us in the hill of Hachilah, before the waste land?
Then Saul went down to the waste land of Ziph, taking with him three thousand of the best men of Israel, to make search for David in the waste land of Ziph.
And Saul put up his tents on the hill of Hachilah, which is in front of the waste land on the road. But David was in the waste land, and he saw that Saul was coming after him.
And so David sent out watchers, and got word from them that Saul was certainly coming.
And David got up and came to the place where Saul ' s tents were : and David had a view of the place where Saul was sleeping with Abner , the son of Ner , the captain of his army : and Saul was sleeping inside the ring of
carts , and the tents of the people were all round him .
Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, Who will go down with me to the tents of Saul? And Abishai said, I will go down with you.
So David and Abishai came down to the army by night: and Saul was sleeping inside the ring of carts with his spear planted in the earth by his head: and Abner and the people were sleeping round him.
Then Abishai said to David, God has given up your hater into your hands today; now let me give him one blow through to the earth with his spear, and there will be no need to give him a second.
And David said to Abishai Do not put him to death; for who, without sin, may put out his hand against the man on whom the Lord has put the holy oil?
And David said, By the living Lord, the Lord will send destruction on him; the natural day of his death will come, or he will go into the fight and come to his end.
Never will my hand be stretched out against the man marked with the holy oil; but take the spear which is by his head and the vessel of water, and let us go.
So David took the spear and the vessel of water from Saul ' s head ; and they got away without any man seeing them , or being conscious of their coming , or awaking ; for they were all sleeping because a deep sleep from the Lord had come
on them .
Then David went over to the other side, and took his place on the top of a mountain some distance away, with a great space between them;
And crying out to the people and to Abner, the son of Ner, David said, Have you no answer to give, Abner? Then Abner said, Who is that crying out to the king?
And David said to Abner , Are you not a man of war ? is there any other like you in Israel ? why then have you not kept watch over your lord the king ? for one of the people came in to put the king your lord to
death .
What you have done is not good . By the living Lord , death is the right fate for you , because you have not kept watch over your lord , the man on whom the Lord has put the holy oil . Now see , where is the king
' s spear , and the vessel of water which was by his head ?
And Saul, conscious that the voice was David's, said, Is that your voice, David, my son? And David said, It is my voice, O my lord king.
And he said, Why does my lord go armed against his servant? what have I done? or what evil is there in me?
Let my lord the king give ear now to the words of his servant . If it is the Lord who is moving you against me , let him take an offering : but if it is the children of men , may they be cursed before the Lord ,
for driving me out today and keeping me from my place in the heritage of the Lord , saying , Go , be the servant of other gods .
Then do not let my blood be drained out on the earth away from the face of the Lord: for the king of Israel has come out to take my life, like one going after birds in the mountains.
Then Saul said, I have done wrong: come back to me, David my son: I will do you no more wrong, because my life was dear to you today truly, I have been foolish and my error is very great.
Then David said, Here is the king's spear! let one of the young men come over and get it.
And the Lord will give to every man the reward of his righteousness and his faith: because the Lord gave you into my hands today, and I would not put out my hand against the man who has been marked with the holy oil.
And so, as your life was dear to me today, may my life be dear to the Lord, and may he make me free from all my troubles.
Then Saul said to David, May a blessing be on you, David, my son; you will do great things and without doubt you will overcome. Then David went on his way, and Saul went back to his place.
And David said to himself , Some day death will come to me by the hand of Saul : the only thing for me to do is to get away into the land of the Philistines ; then Saul will give up hope of taking me in any part of
the land of Israel : and so I may be able to get away from him .
So David and the six hundred men who were with him went over to Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
And David and his men were living with Achish at Gath; every man had his family with him, and David had his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail of Carmel, who had been the wife of Nabal.
And Saul, hearing that David had gone to Gath, went after him no longer.
Then David said to Achish , If now I have grace in your eyes , let me have a place in one of the smaller towns of your land , to be my living-place ; for it is not right for your servant to be living with you in the
king ' s town .
So Achish straight away gave him Ziklag: and for that reason Ziklag has been the property of the kings of Judah to this day.
And David was living in the land of the Philistines for the space of a year and four months.
And David and his men went up and made attacks on the Geshurites and the Girzites and the Amalekites; for these were the people who were living in the land from Telam on the way to Shur, as far as Egypt.
And David again and again made attacks on the land till not a man or a woman was still living; and he took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camels and the clothing; and he came back to Achish.
And every time Achish said, Where have you been fighting today? David said, Against the South of Judah and the South of the Jerahmeelites and the South of the Kenites.
Not one living man or woman did David ever take back with him to Gath , fearing that they might give an account of what had taken place , and say , This is what David did , and so has he been doing all the time while he has
been living in the land of the Philistines .
And Achish had belief in what David said, saying, He has made himself hated by all his people Israel, and so he will be my servant for ever.
Now in those days the Philistines got their forces together to make war on Israel. And Achish said to David, Certainly you and your men are to go out with me to the fight.
And David said to Achish, You will see now what your servant will do. And Achish said to David, Then I will make you keeper of my head for ever.
Now Samuel was dead , and all Israel , after weeping for him , had put his body in its last resting-place in Ramah , his town . And Saul had put away from the land all those who had control of spirits and who made use of secret arts
And the Philistines came together and put their forces in position in Shunem; and Saul got all Israel together and they took up their positions in Gilboa.
And when Saul saw the Philistine army he was troubled, and his heart was moved with fear.
And when Saul went for directions to the Lord, the Lord gave him no answer, by a dream or by the Urim or by the prophets.
Then Saul said to his servants, Get me a woman who has control of a spirit so that I may go to her and get directions. And his servants said to him, There is such a woman at En-dor.
So Saul , putting on other clothing , so that he might not be seen to be the king , took two men with him and went to the woman by night ; and he said , Now , with the help of the spirit which you have , make
the person whose name I will give you come up .
And the woman said to him , But you have knowledge of what Saul has done , how he has put away out of the land those who have control of spirits and the users of secret arts : why would you , by a trick , put me in
danger of death ?
And Saul made an oath to her by the Lord, saying, By the living Lord, no punishment will come to you for this.
Then the woman said, Who am I to let you see? And he said, Make Samuel come up for me.
And the woman saw that it was Saul, and she gave a loud cry, and said to Saul, Why have you made use of deceit? for you are Saul.
And the king said to her, Have no fear: what do you see? And the woman said to Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth.
And he said to her, What is his form? And she said, It is an old man coming up covered with a robe. And Saul saw that it was Samuel, and with his face bent down to the earth he gave him honour.
And Samuel said to Saul , Why have you made me come up , troubling my rest ? And Saul in answer said , I am in great danger ; for the Philistines are making war on me , and God has gone away from me and will no longer
give me any answer , by the prophets or by dreams : so I have sent for you to make clear to me what I am to do .
And Samuel said, Why do you put your questions to me, seeing that God has gone away from you and is on the side of him who is against you?
And the Lord himself has done what I said: the Lord has taken the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbour David;
Because you did not do what the Lord said, and did not give effect to his burning wrath against Amalek. So the Lord has done this thing to you today.
And more than this, the Lord will give Israel up with you into the hands of the Philistines: and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me: and the Lord will give up the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.
Then Saul went down flat on the earth, and was full of fear because of Samuel's words: and there was no strength in him, for he had taken no food all that day or all that night.
And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was in great trouble, and said to him, See now, your servant has given ear to your words, and I have put my life in danger by doing what you said.
So now, give ear to the voice of your servant, and let me give you a little bread; and take some food to give you strength when you go on your way.
But he would not , saying , I have no desire for food . But his servants , together with the woman , made him take food , and he gave way to them . So he got up from the earth , and took his seat on the bed
And the woman had in the house a young cow, made fat for food; and she put it to death straight away; and she took meal and got it mixed and made unleavened bread;
And she put it before Saul and his servants, and they had a meal. Then they got up and went away the same night.
Now the Philistines got all their army together at Aphek: and the Israelites put their forces in position by the fountain in Jezreel.
And the lords of the Philistines went on with their hundreds and their thousands, and David and his men came after with Achish.
Then the rulers of the Philistines said , What are these Hebrews doing here ? And Achish said to the rulers of the Philistines , Is this not David , the servant of Saul the king of Israel , who has been with me for a year or two ,
and I have never seen any wrong in him from the time when he came to me till now ?
But the rulers of the Philistines were angry with him , and said to him , Make the man go back to the place you have given him ; do not let him go down with us to the fight , or he may be turned against us and be
false to us : for how will this man make peace with his lord ? will it not be with the heads of these men ?
Is this not David, who was named in their songs, when in the dance they said to one another, Saul has put to death thousands, and David tens of thousands?
Then Achish sent for David and said to him , By the living Lord , you are upright , and everything you have done with me in the army has been pleasing to me : I have seen no evil in you from the day when you came to me
till now : but still , the lords are not pleased with you .
So now go back, and go in peace, so that you do not make the lords of the Philistines angry.
And David said to Achish , But what have I done ? what have you seen in your servant while I have been with you till this day , that I may not go and take up arms against those who are now making war on my lord the king
And Achish in answer said, It is true that in my eyes you are good, like an angel of God: but still, the rulers of the Philistines have said, He is not to go up with us to the fight.
So get up early in the morning , with the servants of your lord who are with you , and go to the place I have given you , and have no evil design in your heart , for you are good in my eyes ; but when there is
light enough in the morning , go away .
So David and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
Now the young Samuel was the servant of the Lord before Eli. In those days the Lord kept his word secret from men; there was no open vision.
And at that time, when Eli was resting in his place, (now his eyes were becoming clouded so that he was not able to see,)
And the light of God was still burning, while Samuel was sleeping in the Temple of the Lord where the ark of God was,
The voice of the Lord said Samuel's name; and he said, Here am I.
And running to Eli he said, Here am I, for you said my name. And Eli said, I did not say your name; go to your rest again. So he went back to his bed.
And again the Lord said, Samuel. And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, Here am I; for you certainly said my name. But he said in answer, I said nothing, my son; go to your rest again.
Now at that time Samuel had no knowledge of the Lord, and the revelation of the word of the Lord had not come to him.
And for the third time the Lord said Samuel ' s name . And he got up and went to Eli and said , Here am I ; for you certainly said my name . Then it was clear to Eli that the voice which had said the child '
s name was the Lord ' s .
So Eli said to Samuel, Go back: and if the voice comes again, let your answer be, Say on, Lord; for the ears of your servant are open. So Samuel went back to his bed.
Then the Lord came and said as before, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel made answer, Say on, Lord; for the ears of your servant are open.
And the Lord said to Samuel, See, I will do a thing in Israel at which the ears of everyone hearing of it will be burning.
In that day I will do to Eli everything which I have said about his family, from first to last.
And you are to say to him that I will send punishment on his family for ever, for the sin which he had knowledge of; because his sons have been cursing God and he had no control over them.
So I have made an oath to the family of Eli that no offering of meat or of meal which they may make will ever take away the sin of his family.
And Samuel kept where he was, not moving till the time came for opening the doors of the house of God in the morning. And fear kept him from giving Eli an account of his vision.
Then Eli said, Samuel, my son. And Samuel answering said, Here am I.
And he said, What did the Lord say to you? Do not keep it from me: may God's punishment be on you if you keep from me anything he said to you.
Then Samuel gave him an account of everything, keeping nothing back. And he said, It is the Lord; let him do what seems good to him.
And Samuel became older, and the Lord was with him and let not one of his words be without effect.
And it was clear to all Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba that Samuel had been made a prophet of the Lord.
And the Lord was seen again in Shiloh; for the Lord gave to Samuel in Shiloh the revelation of his word.
Now when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had made an attack on the South and on Ziklag, and had overcome Ziklag and put it on fire;
And had made the women and all who were there, small and great, prisoners: they had not put any of them to death, but had taken them all away.
And when David and his men came to the town, they saw that it had been burned down, and their wives and their sons and daughters had been made prisoners.
Then David and the people who were with him gave themselves up to weeping till they were able to go on weeping no longer.
And David's two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the wife of Nabal of Carmel, had been made prisoners.
And David was greatly troubled; for the people were talking of stoning him, because their hearts were bitter, every man sorrowing for his sons and his daughters: but David made himself strong in the Lord his God.
And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, Come here to me with the ephod. And Abiathar took the ephod to David.
Then David, questioning the Lord, said, Am I to go after this band? will I be able to overtake them? And in answer he said, Go after them, for you will certainly overtake them, and get back everything.
So David went, and his six hundred men went with him, and they came to the stream Besor.
And David, with four hundred men, went on: but two hundred of them were overcome with weariness, and not able to go across the stream.
And in the fields they saw an Egyptian whom they took to David, and they gave him bread, and he had a meal, and they gave him water for drink;
And they gave him part of a cake of figs and some dry grapes; and after the food, his spirit came back to him, for he had had no food or drink for three days and nights.
And David said to him, Whose man are you and where do you come from? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master went on without me because three days back I became ill.
We made an attack on the south part of the country of the Cherethites, and on the land which is Judah's, and on the south of Caleb; and we put Ziklag on fire.
And David said to him, Will you take me down to this band? And he said, If you give me your oath that you will not put me to death or give me up to my master, I will take you to them.
And when he had taken him down, they saw them all, seated about on all sides, feasting and drinking among all the mass of goods which they had taken from the land of the Philistines and the land of Judah.
And David went on fighting them from evening till the evening of the day after; and not one of them got away but only four hundred young men who went in flight on camels.
And David got back everything the Amalekites had taken; and he got back his two wives.
There was no loss of anything, small or great, sons or daughters or goods or anything which they had taken away: David got it all back.
And they took all the flocks and herds, and driving them in front of him, said, These are David's.
And David came to the two hundred men , who because of weariness had not gone with him , but were waiting at the stream Besor : and they went out , meeting David and the people who were with him ; and when they came near them , they
said , How are you ?
Then the bad and good-for-nothing men among those who went with David said , Because they did not go with us , we will give them nothing of the goods which we have got back , but only to every man his wife and children , so that he may
take them and go .
Then David said, You are not to do this, my brothers, after what the Lord has given us, who has kept us safe and given up the band which came against us into our hands.
Who is going to give any attention to you in this question? for an equal part will be given to him who went to the fight and to him who was waiting by the goods: they are all to have the same.
And so he made it a rule and an order for Israel from that day till now.
And when David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the goods to the responsible men of Judah, and to his friends, saying, Here is an offering for you from the goods of those who were fighting against the Lord;
He sent to those who were in Beth-el, and in Ramah of the South, and in Jattir;
And to those in Arara and Eshtemoa
and Carmel and in the towns of the Jerahmeelites, and in the towns of the Kenites;
And to those who were in Hormah and in Bor-ashan and in Athach;
And in Hebron, and to all the places where David and his men had been living.
Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel: and the men of Israel went in flight before the Philistines, falling down wounded in Mount Gilboa.
And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and they put to death Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
And the fight was going badly for Saul, and the archers came across him, and he was wounded by the archers.
Then Saul said to the servant who had the care of his arms , Take out your sword and put it through me , before these men without circumcision come and make sport of me . But his servant , full of fear , would not do so . Then
Saul took out his sword , and falling on it , put an end to himself .
And when his servant saw that Saul was dead, he did the same, and was united with him in death.
So death overtook Saul and his three sons and his servant on the same day.
And when the men of Israel across the valley and on the other side of Jordan saw that the army of Israel was in flight and that Saul and his sons were dead , they came out of their towns and went in flight ; and the Philistines came and
took them for themselves .
Now on the day after, when the Philistines came to take their goods from the dead, they saw Saul and his three sons dead on the earth in Mount Gilboa.
And cutting off his head and taking away his war-dress, they sent word into the land of the Philistines round about, to take the news to their gods and to the people.
His war-dress they put in the house of Astarte; and his body was fixed on the wall of Beth-shan.
And when the people of Jabesh-gilead had news of what the Philistines had done to Saul,
All the fighting men got up and, travelling all night, took Saul's body and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh and had them burned there.
And their bones they put in the earth under a tree in Jabesh; and for seven days they took no food.
Now at that time the Philistines came together to make war against Israel, and the men of Israel went out to war against the Philistines and took up their position at the side of Eben-ezer: and the Philistines put their forces in position in Aphek.
And the Philistines put their forces in order against Israel, and the fighting was hard, and Israel was overcome by the Philistines, who put to the sword about four thousand of their army in the field.
And when the people came back to their tents , the responsible men of Israel said , Why has the Lord let the Philistines overcome us today ? Let us get the ark of the Lord ' s agreement here from Shiloh , so that it may be with us
and give us salvation from the hands of those who are against us .
So the people sent to Shiloh and got the ark of the agreement of the Lord of armies whose resting-place is between the winged ones; and Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were there with the ark of God's agreement.
And when the ark of the Lord's agreement came into the tent-circle, all Israel gave a great cry, so that the earth was sounding with it.
And the Philistines, hearing the noise of their cry, said, What is this great cry among the tents of the Hebrews? Then it became clear to them that the ark of the Lord had come to the tent-circle.
And the Philistines, full of fear, said, God has come into their tents. And they said, Trouble is ours! for never before has such a thing been seen.
Trouble is ours! Who will give us salvation from the hands of these great gods? These are the gods who sent all sorts of blows on the Egyptians in the waste land.
Be strong, O Philistines, be men! Do not be servants to the Hebrews as they have been to you: go forward to the fight without fear.
So the Philistines went to the fight, and Israel was overcome, and every man went in flight to his tent: and great was the destruction, for thirty thousand footmen of Israel were put to the sword.
And the ark of God was taken; and Hophni and Phinehas, the sons of Eli, were put to the sword.
And a man of Benjamin went running from the fight and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothing out of order and earth on his head.
And when he came, Eli was seated by the wayside watching: and in his heart was fear for the ark of God. And when the man came into the town and gave the news, there was a great outcry.
And Eli, hearing the noise and the cries, said, What is the reason of this outcry? And the man came quickly and gave the news to Eli.
Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were fixed so that he was not able to see.
And the man said to Eli, I have come from the army and have come in flight today from the fight. And he said, How did it go, my son?
And the man said, Israel went in flight from the Philistines, and there has been great destruction among the people, and your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been taken.
And at these words about the ark of God , Eli , falling back off his seat by the side of the doorway into the town , came down on the earth so that his neck was broken and death overtook him , for he was an old man and
of great weight . He had been judging Israel for forty years .
And his daughter-in-law , the wife of Phinehas , was with child and near the time when she would give birth ; and when she had the news that the ark of God had been taken and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead , her pains came on
her suddenly and she gave birth .
And when she was very near death the women who were with her said, Have no fear, for you have given birth to a son. But she made no answer and gave no attention to it.
And she gave the child the name of Ichabod, saying, The glory has gone from Israel: because the ark of God was taken and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
And she said, The glory is gone from Israel, for the ark of God has been taken.
Now the Philistines, having taken the ark of God, took it with them from Eben-ezer to Ashdod.
They took the ark of God into the house of Dagon and put it by the side of Dagon.
And when the people of Ashdod got up early on the morning after, they saw that Dagon had come down to the earth on his face before the ark of the Lord. And they took Dagon up and put him in his place again.
And when they got up early on the morning after, Dagon had come down to the earth on his face before the ark of the Lord; and his head and his hands were broken off on the doorstep; only the base was in its place.
So to this day no priest of Dagon, or any who come into Dagon's house, will put his foot on the doorstep of the house of Dagon in Ashdod.
But the hand of the Lord was hard on the people of Ashdod and he sent disease on them through all the country of Ashdod.
And when the men of Ashdod saw how it was, they said, Let not the ark of the God of Israel be with us, for his hand is hard on us and on Dagon our god.
So they sent for all the lords of the Philistines to come together there , and said , What are we to do with the ark of the God of Israel ? And their answer was , Let the ark of the God of Israel be taken away to Gath
. So they took the ark of the God of Israel away .
But after they had taken it away, the hand of the Lord was stretched out against the town for its destruction: and the signs of disease came out on all the men of the town, small and great.
So they sent the ark of God to Ekron . And when the ark of God came to Ekron , the people of the town made an outcry , saying , They have sent the ark of the God of Israel to us for the destruction of us and of
our people .
So they sent and got together all the lords of the Philistines , and they said , Send away the ark of the God of Israel , and let it go back to its place , so that it may not be the cause of death to us and to
our people : for there was a great fear of death through all the town ; the hand of God was very hard on them there .
And those men who were not overtaken by death were cruelly diseased: and the cry of the town went up to heaven.
Now the ark of the Lord was in the country of the Philistines for seven months.
And the Philistines sent for the priests and those who were wise in secret arts, and said to them, What are we to do with the ark of the Lord? How are we to send it away to its place?
And they said , If you send away the ark of the God of Israel , do not send it without an offering , but send him a sin-offering with it : then you will have peace again , and it will be clear to you why the weight of
his hand has not been lifted from you .
Then they said , What sin-offering are we to send to him ? And they said , Five gold images of the growths caused by your disease and five gold mice , one for every lord of the Philistines : for the same disease came on you and on your
lords .
So make images of the growths caused by your disease and of the mice which are damaging your land ; and give glory to the God of Israel : it may be that the weight of his hand will be lifted from you and from your gods and from your
land .
Why do you make your hearts hard, like the hearts of Pharaoh and the Egyptians? When he had made sport of them, did they not let the people go, and they went away?
So now, take and make ready a new cart, and two cows which have never come under the yoke, and have the cows yoked to the cart, and take their young ones away from them:
And put the ark of the Lord on the cart, and the gold images which you are sending as a sin-offering in a chest by its side; and send it away so that it may go.
If it goes by the land of Israel to Beth-shemesh, then this great evil is his work; but if not, then we may be certain that the evil was not his doing, but was the working of chance.
And the men did so; they took two cows, yoking them to the cart and shutting up their young ones in their living-place:
And they put the ark of the Lord on the cart and the chest with the gold images.
And the cows took the straight way , by the road to Beth-shemesh ; they went by the highway , not turning to the right or to the left , and the sound of their voices was clear on the road ; and the lords of the Philistines went after
them as far as the edge of Beth-shemesh .
And the people of Beth-shemesh were cutting their grain in the valley, and lifting up their eyes they saw the ark and were full of joy when they saw it.
And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, and came to a stop there by a great stone: and cutting up the wood of the cart they made a burned offering of the cows to the Lord.
Then the Levites took down the ark of the Lord and the chest in which were the gold images, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh made burned offerings and gave worship that day before the Lord.
And the five lords of the Philistines, having seen it, went back to Ekron the same day.
Now these are the gold images which the Philistines sent as a sin-offering to the Lord; one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron;
And the gold mice , one for every town of the Philistines , the property of the five lords , walled towns as well as country places : and the great stone where they put the ark of the Lord is still in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite to
this day .
But the Lord sent destruction on seventy men of the people of Beth-shemesh for looking into the ark of the Lord; and great was the sorrow of the people for the destruction which the Lord had sent on them.
And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to keep his place before the Lord, this holy God? and to whom may he go from us?
And they sent men to the people living in Kiriath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have sent back the ark of the Lord; come and take it up to your country.
So the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took the ark of the Lord to the house of Abinadab in Gibeah, and they made his son Eleazar holy and put the ark in his care.
And the ark was in Kiriath-jearim for a long time, as much as twenty years: and all Israel was searching after the Lord with weeping.
Then Samuel said to all Israel , If with all your hearts you would come back to the Lord , then put away all the strange gods and the Astartes from among you , and let your hearts be turned to the Lord , and be servants to him only
: and he will make you safe from the hands of the Philistines .
So the children of Israel gave up the worship of Baal and Astarte, and became worshippers of the Lord only.
Then Samuel said, Let all Israel come to Mizpah and I will make prayer to the Lord for you.
So they came together to Mizpah, and got water, draining it out before the Lord, and they took no food that day, and they said, We have done evil against the Lord. And Samuel was judge of the children of Israel in Mizpah.
Now when the Philistines had news that the children of Israel had come together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And the children of Israel, hearing of it, were full of fear.
And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Go on crying to the Lord our God for us to make us safe from the hands of the Philistines.
And Samuel took a young lamb, offering all of it as a burned offering to the Lord; and Samuel made prayers to the Lord for Israel and the Lord gave him an answer.
And while Samuel was offering the burned offering, the Philistines came near for the attack on Israel; but at the thunder of the Lord's voice that day the Philistines were overcome with fear, and they gave way before Israel.
And the men of Israel went out from Mizpah and went after the Philistines, attacking them till they came under Beth-car.
Then Samuel took a stone and put it up between Mizpah and Jeshanah, naming it Eben-ezer, and saying, Up to now the Lord has been our help.
So the Philistines were overcome, and did not come into the country of Israel again: and all the days of Samuel the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines.
And the towns which the Philistines had taken were given back to Israel, from Ekron to Gath, and all the country round them Israel made free from the power of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
And Samuel was judge of Israel all the days of his life.
From year to year he went in turn to Beth-el and Gilgal and Mizpah, judging Israel in all those places.
And his base was at Ramah, where his house was; there he was judge of Israel and there he made an altar to the Lord.
Now when Samuel was old, he made his sons judges over Israel.
The name of his first son was Joel and the name of his second Abijah: they were judges in Beer-sheba.
And his sons did not go in his ways, but moved by the love of money took rewards, and were not upright in judging.
Then all the responsible men of Israel got together and went to Samuel at Ramah,
And said to him, See now, you are old, and your sons do not go in your ways: give us a king now to be our judge, so that we may be like the other nations.
But Samuel was not pleased when they said to him, Give us a king to be our judge. And Samuel made prayer to the Lord.
And the Lord said to Samuel, Give ear to the voice of the people and what they say to you: they have not been turned away from you, but they have been turned away from me, not desiring me to be king over them.
As they have done from the first, from the day when I took them out of Egypt till this day, turning away from me and worshipping other gods, so now they are acting in the same way to you.
Give ear now to their voice: but make a serious protest to them, and give them a picture of the sort of king who will be their ruler.
And Samuel said all these words of the Lord to the people who were desiring a king.
And he said, This is the sort of king who will be your ruler: he will take your sons and make them his servants, his horsemen, and drivers of his war-carriages, and they will go running before his war-carriages;
And he will make them captains of thousands and of fifties; some he will put to work ploughing and cutting his grain and making his instruments of war and building his war-carriages.
Your daughters he will take to be makers of perfumes and cooks and bread-makers.
He will take your fields and your vine-gardens and your olive-gardens, all the best of them, and give them to his servants.
He will take a tenth of your seed and of the fruit of your vines and give it to his servants.
He will take your men-servants and your servant-girls, and the best of your oxen and your asses and put them to his work.
He will take a tenth of your sheep: and you will be his servants.
Then you will be crying out because of your king whom you have taken for yourselves; but the Lord will not give you an answer in that day.
But the people gave no attention to the voice of Samuel; and they said, No, but we will have a king over us,
So that we may be like the other nations, and so that our king may be our judge and go out before us to war.
Then Samuel, after hearing all the people had to say, went and gave an account of it to the Lord.
And the Lord said to Samuel, Give ear to their voice and make a king for them. Then Samuel said to the men of Israel, Let every man go back to his town.
Now there was a man of Benjamin named Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a man of wealth.
He had a son named Saul, a specially good-looking young man; there was no one better-looking among the children of Israel: he was taller by a head than any other of the people.
Now the asses of Saul's father Kish had gone wandering away. And Kish said to his son Saul, Take one of the servants with you, and get up and go in search of the asses.
So they went through the hill-country of Ephraim and through the land of Shalishah , but they saw no sign of them : then they went through the land of Shaalim , but they were not there : and they went through the land of the Benjamites , but they
did not come across them .
And when they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, Come, let us go back, or my father may give up caring about the asses and be troubled about us.
But the servant said to him , See now , in this town there is a man of God , who is highly honoured , and everything he says comes true : let us go there now ; it may be that he will give us directions about our journey
Then Saul said to his servant, But if we go, what are we to take the man? all our bread is gone, and we have no offering to take to the man of God: what are we to do?
But the servant said in answer, I have here a fourth part of a shekel of silver: I will give that to the man of God, and he will give us directions about our way.
(In the past in Israel, when a man went to get directions from God, he said, Come let us go to the Seer, for he who now is named Prophet was in those days given the name of Seer.)
Then Saul said to his servant, You have said well; come, let us go. So they went to the town where the man of God was.
And when they were on the way up to the town, they saw some young girls going out to get water and said to them, Is the seer here?
And they said, He is; in fact he is before you: go quickly now, for he has come into the town today, for the people are making an offering in the high place today:
When you come into the town you will see him straight away , before he goes up to the high place for the feast : the people are waiting for his blessing before starting the feast , and after that the guests will take part in it . So go
up now and you will see him .
So they went up to the town, and when they came inside the town, Samuel came face to face with them on his way to the high place.
Now the day before Saul came, the word of God had come to Samuel, saying,
Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin , and on him you are to put the holy oil , making him ruler over my people Israel , and he will make my people safe from the hands of the Philistines : for
I have seen the sorrow of my people , whose cry has come up to me .
And when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said to him, This is the man of whom I gave you word! he it is who is to have authority over my people.
Then Saul came up to Samuel in the doorway of the town and said, Give me directions, if you will be so good, to the house of the seer.
Then Samuel said to Saul, I am the seer; go up before me to the high place and take food with me today: and in the morning I will let you go, after opening to you all the secrets of your heart.
As for your asses which have been wandering for three days, give no thought to them, for they have come back. And for whom are all the desired things in Israel? are they not for you and your father's family?
And Saul said, Am I not a man of Benjamin, the smallest of all the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of the families of Benjamin? why then do you say these words to me?
Then Samuel took Saul and his servant into the guest room, and made them take the chief place among all the guests who were there, about thirty persons.
And Samuel said to the cook, Give me that part which I gave you orders to keep by you.
And the cook took up the leg with the fat tail on it , and put it before Saul . And Samuel said , This is the part which has been kept for you : take it as your part of the feast ; because it has been kept for
you till the right time came and till the guests were present . So that day Saul took food with Samuel .
And when they had come down from the high place into the town, where a bed was made ready for Saul, he went to rest.
And about dawn Samuel said to Saul on the roof, Get up so that I may send you away. So Saul got up, and he and Samuel went out together.
And on their way down to the end of the town , Samuel said to Saul , Give your servant orders to go on in front of us , ( so he went on , ) but you keep here , so that I may give you the word of
God .
And Solomon, the son of David, made himself strong in his kingdom, and the Lord his God was with him, and made him very great.
And Solomon sent word to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every chief in all Israel, heads of their families.
Then Solomon, and all the men of Israel with him, went to the high place at Gibeon, because the Tent of meeting of God, which Moses, the servant of the Lord, had made in the waste land, was there.
But the ark of God had been moved by David from Kiriath-jearim to the place which he had made ready for it, for he had put up a tent for it at Jerusalem.
And the altar of brass which Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the Tent of the Lord; and Solomon and all the people went to give worship there.
And Solomon went up there to the brass altar before the Lord at the Tent of meeting, offering on it a thousand burned offerings.
In that night God came to Solomon in a vision, and said to him, Say what I am to give you.
And Solomon said to God, Great was your mercy to David my father, and you have made me king in his place.
Now, O Lord God, let your word to David my father come true; for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in number.
Give me now wisdom and knowledge, so that I may go out and come in before this people: for who is able to be the judge of this great people of yours?
And God said to Solomon , Because this was in your heart , and you did not make request for money , property , or honour , or for the destruction of your haters , or for long life ; but you have made request for wisdom and knowledge for
yourself , so that you may be the judge of my people over whom I have made you king :
Wisdom and knowledge are given to you; and I will give you wealth and honour, such as no king has had before you or ever will have after you.
So Solomon went back from the high place at Gibeon, from before the Tent of meeting, to Jerusalem; and he was king over Israel.
And Solomon got together war-carriages and horsemen; he had one thousand, four hundred carriages and twelve thousand horsemen, which he kept, some in the carriage-towns and some with the king at Jerusalem.
And the king made silver and gold as common as stones in Jerusalem, and cedar like the sycamore-trees of the lowland in number.
And Solomon's horses came out of Egypt; the king's traders got them from Kue at a price.
A war-carriage might be got from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: they got them at the same rate for all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.
And Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all Israel had come together to make him king.
And when Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, had news of it, (for he was in Egypt where he had gone in flight from King Solomon,) he came back from Egypt.
And they sent for him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came to Rehoboam and said,
Your father put a hard yoke on us: if you will make the conditions under which your father kept us down less cruel, and the weight of the yoke he put on us less hard, then we will be your servants.
And he said to them, Come to me again after three days. So the people went away.
Then King Rehoboam took the opinion of the old men who had been with Solomon his father when he was living, and said, In your opinion, what answer am I to give to this people?
And they said to him, If you are kind to this people, pleasing them and saying good words to them, then they will be your servants for ever.
But he gave no attention to the opinion of the old men, but went to the young men of his generation who were waiting before him.
And he said to them, What is your opinion? What answer are we to give to this people who have said to me, Make less the weight of the yoke which your father put on us?
And the young men of his generation said to him , This is the answer to give to the people who came to you saying , Your father put a hard yoke on us , but will you make it less ; say to them , My little finger is
thicker than my father ' s body ;
If my father put a hard yoke on you, I will make it harder: my father gave you punishment with whips, but I will give you blows with snakes.
So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had given orders, saying, Come to me again on the third day.
And the king gave them a rough answer. So King Rehoboam gave no attention to the suggestion of the old men,
But gave them the answer put forward by the young men, saying, My father made your yoke hard, but I will make it harder; my father gave you punishment with whips, but I will give it with snakes.
So the king did not give ear to the people; for this came about by the purpose of God, so that the Lord might give effect to his word which he had said by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam, the son of Nebat.
And when all Israel saw that the king would give no attention to them , the people in answer said to the king , What part have we in David ? what is our heritage in the son of Jesse ? every man to your tents , O Israel ;
now see to your house , David . So all Israel went to their tents .
But Rehoboam was still king over those of the children of Israel who were living in the towns of Judah.
Then Rehoboam sent Adoniram, the overseer of the forced work; and he was stoned to death by all Israel. And King Rehoboam went quickly and got into his carriage to go in flight to Jerusalem.
So Israel was turned away from the family of David to this day.
And Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, and got together the men of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand of his best fighting-men, to make war against Israel and get the kingdom back for Rehoboam.
But the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, the man of God, saying,
Say to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin,
The Lord has said , You are not to go to war against your brothers : let every man go back to his house , for this thing is my purpose . So they gave ear to the words of the Lord and were turned back from fighting against Jeroboam
Now Rehoboam kept in Jerusalem, building walled towns in Judah.
He was the builder of Beth-lehem and Etam and Tekoa
And Beth-zur and Soco and Adullam
And Gath and Mareshah and Ziph
And Adoraim and Lachish and Azekah
And Zorah and Aijalon and Hebron, walled towns in Judah and Benjamin.
And he made the walled towns strong, and he put captains in them and stores of food, oil, and wine.
And in every town he put stores of body-covers and spears, and made them very strong. And Judah and Benjamin were his.
And the priests and Levites who were in all Israel came together to him from every part of their country.
For the Levites gave up their living-places and their property, and came to Judah and Jerusalem; for Jeroboam and his sons had sent them away, not letting them be priests to the Lord;
And he himself made priests for the high places, and for the images of he-goats and oxen which he had made.
And after them, from all the tribes of Israel, all those whose hearts were fixed and true to the Lord, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to make offerings to the Lord, the God of their fathers.
So they went on increasing the power of the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, strong for three years; and for three years they went in the ways of David and Solomon.
And Rehoboam took as his wife Mahalath, the daughter of Jerimoth, the son of David and of Abihail, the daughter of Eliab, the son of Jesse;
And she had sons by him, Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.
And after her he took Maacah, the daughter of Absalom; and she had Abijah and Attai and Ziza and Shelomith by him.
Maacah, the daughter of Absalom, was dearer to Rehoboam than all his wives and his servant-wives: (for he had eighteen wives and sixty servant-wives, and was the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.)
Rehoboam made Abijah, the son of Maacah, chief and ruler among his brothers, for it was his purpose to make him king.
And in his wisdom he had his sons stationed in every walled town through all the lands of Judah and Benjamin; and he gave them a great store of food, and took wives for them.
Now when Rehoboam's position as king had been made certain, and he was strong, he gave up the law of the Lord, and all Israel with him.
Now in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem, because of their sin against the Lord,
With twelve hundred war-carriages and sixty thousand horsemen: and the people who came with him out of Egypt were more than might be numbered: Lubim and Sukkiim and Ethiopians.
And he took the walled towns of Judah, and came as far as Jerusalem.
Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the chiefs of Judah , who had come together in Jerusalem because of Shishak , and said to them , The Lord has said , Because you have given me up , I have given you up into the hands of Shishak
Then the chiefs of Israel and the king made themselves low and said, The Lord is upright.
And the Lord , seeing that they had made themselves low , said to Shemaiah , They have made themselves low : I will not send destruction on them , but in a short time I will give them salvation , and will not let loose my wrath on Jerusalem
by the hand of Shishak .
But still they will become his servants, so that they may see how different my yoke is from the yoke of the kingdoms of the lands.
So Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem and took away all the stored wealth of the house of the Lord and the king's house: he took everything away, and with the rest the gold body-covers which Solomon had made.
And in their place King Rehoboam had other body-covers made of brass and gave them into the care of the captains of the armed men who were stationed at the door of the king's house.
And whenever the king went into the house of the Lord, the armed men went with him taking the body-covers, and then took them back to their room.
And when he made himself low, the wrath of the Lord was turned back from him, and complete destruction did not come on him, for there was still some good in Judah.
So King Rehoboam made himself strong in Jerusalem and was ruling there . Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king , and he was ruling for seventeen years in Jerusalem , the town which the Lord had made his out of all the tribes of Israel , to
put his name there ; and his mother ' s name was Naamah , an Ammonite woman .
And he did evil because his heart was not true to the Lord.
Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not recorded in the words of Shemaiah the prophet and Iddo the seer? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.
And Rehoboam went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth in the town of David; and Abijah his son became king in his place.
In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah.
He was king in Jerusalem for three years; his mother's name was Maacah, the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
And Abijah went out to the fight with an army of men of war, four hundred thousand of his best men; and Jeroboam put his forces in line against him, eight hundred thousand of his best men of war.
And Abijah took up his position on Mount Zemaraim, in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Give ear to me, O Jeroboam and all Israel:
Is it not clear to you that the Lord, the God of Israel, gave the rule over Israel to David and to his sons for ever, by an agreement made with salt?
But Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon, the son of David, took up arms against his lord.
And certain foolish and good-for-nothing men were joined with him, and made themselves strong against Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, when he was young and untested and not able to keep them back.
And now it is your purpose to put yourselves against the authority which the Lord has put into the hands of the sons of David, and you are a very great number, and you have with you the gold oxen which Jeroboam made to be your gods.
And after driving out the priests of the Lord , the sons of Aaron and the Levites , have you not made priests for yourselves as the people of other lands do ? so that anyone who comes to make himself priest by offering an ox or seven sheep ,
may be a priest of those who are no gods .
But as for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not been turned away from him; we have priests who do the work of the Lord, even the sons of Aaron and the Levites in their places;
By whom burned offerings and perfumes are sent up in smoke before the Lord every morning and every evening ; and they put out the holy bread on its table and the gold support for the lights with its lights burning every evening ; for we keep the orders given
to us by the Lord our God , but you have gone away from him .
And now God is with us at our head, and his priests with their loud horns sounding against you. O children of Israel, do not make war on the Lord, the God of your fathers, for it will not go well for you.
But Jeroboam had put some of his men to make a surprise attack on them from the back, so some were facing Judah and others were stationed secretly at their back.
And Judah, turning their faces, saw that they were being attacked in front and at the back; and they gave a cry for help to the Lord, while the priests were sounding their horns.
And the men of Judah gave a loud cry; and at their cry, God put fear into Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
And the children of Israel went in flight before Judah, and God gave them up into their hands.
And Abijah and his people put them to death with great destruction: five hundred thousand of the best of Israel were put to the sword.
So at that time the children of Israel were overcome, and the children of Judah got the better of them, because they put their faith in the Lord, the God of their fathers.
And Abijah went after Jeroboam and took some of his towns, Beth-el with its small towns and Jeshanah with its small towns and Ephron with its small towns.
And Jeroboam did not get back his power again in the life-time of Abijah; and the Lord sent death on him.
But Abijah became great, and had fourteen wives, and became the father of twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways and his sayings, are recorded in the account of the prophet Iddo.
So Abijah went to rest with his fathers, and they put him into the earth in the town of David, and Asa his son became king in his place; in his time the land was quiet for ten years.
And Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God;
For he took away the altars of strange gods and the high places, and had the upright stones broken and the wood pillars cut down;
And he made Judah go after the Lord, the God of their fathers, and keep his laws and his orders.
And he took away the high places and the sun-images from all the towns of Judah; and the kingdom was quiet under his rule.
He made walled towns in Judah, for the land was quiet and there were no wars in those years, because the Lord had given him rest.
He said to Judah , Let us make these towns , building walls round them with towers and doors and locks . The land is still ours , because we have been true to the Lord our God ; we have been true to him and he has given us
rest on every side . So they went on building and all went well for them .
And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand men of Judah armed with body-covers and spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand of Benjamin armed with body-covers and bows; all these were men of war.
And Zerah the Ethiopian, with an army of a million, and three hundred war-carriages, came out against them to Mareshah.
And Asa went out against him, and they put their forces in position in the valley north of Mareshah.
And Asa made prayer to the Lord his God and said , Lord , you only are able to give help against the strong to him who has no strength ; come to our help , O Lord our God , for our hope is in you , and in
your name we have come out against this great army . O Lord , you are our God ; let not man ' s power be greater than yours .
So the Lord sent fear on the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah; and the Ethiopians went in flight.
And Asa and the people who were with him went after them as far as Gerar ; and so great was the destruction among the Ethiopians that they were not able to get their army together again , for they were broken before the Lord and before his army ;
and they took away a great amount of their goods .
And they overcame all the towns round Gerar, because the Lord sent fear on them; and they took away their goods from the towns, for there were stores of wealth in them.
And they made an attack on the tents of the owners of the cattle, and took away great numbers of sheep and camels and went back to Jerusalem.
And the spirit of God came on Azariah, the son of Oded;
And he came face to face with Asa and said to him , Give ear to me , Asa and all Judah and Benjamin : the Lord is with you while you are with him ; if your heart ' s desire is for him , he will be near
you , but if you give him up , he will give you up .
Now for a long time Israel has been without the true God, and without a teaching priest and without the law;
But when in their trouble they were turned to the Lord, the God of Israel, searching after him, he let their search be rewarded.
In those times there was no peace for him who went out or for him who came in, but great trouble was on all the people of the lands.
And they were broken by divisions, nation against nation and town against town, because God sent all sorts of trouble on them.
But be you strong and let not your hands be feeble, for your work will be rewarded.
And Asa , hearing these words of Azariah , the son of Oded the prophet , took heart and put away all the disgusting things out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin , and out of the towns which he had taken from the hill-country of Ephraim ;
and he made new again the altar of the Lord in front of the covered way of the Lord ' s house .
And he got together all Judah and Benjamin and those of Ephraim and Manasseh and Simeon who were living with them; for numbers of them came to him out of Israel when they saw that the Lord his God was with him.
So they came together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the rule of Asa.
And that day they made offerings to the Lord of the things they had taken in war, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
And they made an agreement to be true to the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and all their soul;
And that anyone, small or great, man or woman, who was not true to the Lord, the God of Israel, would be put to death.
And they made an oath to the Lord, with a loud voice, sounding wind-instruments and horns.
And all Judah was glad because of the oath, for they had taken it with all their heart, turning to the Lord with all their desire; and he was with them and gave them rest on every side.
And Asa would not let Maacah, his mother, be queen, because she had made a disgusting image for Asherah; and Asa had her image cut down and broken up and burned by the stream Kidron.
But the high places were not taken away out of Israel; but still the heart of Asa was true to the Lord all his life.
He took into the house of God all the things which his father had made holy and those which he himself had made holy, silver and gold and vessels.
And there was no more war till the thirty-fifth year of the rule of Asa.
In the thirty-sixth year of the rule of Asa, Baasha, king of Israel, went up against Judah, building Ramah so that no one was able to go out or in to Asa, king of Judah.
Then Asa took silver and gold out of the stores of the Lord's house and of the king's store-house, and sent to Ben-hadad, king of Aram, at Damascus, saying,
Let there be an agreement between me and you as there was between my father and your father : see , I have sent you silver and gold ; go and put an end to your agreement with Baasha , king of Israel , so that he may give up
attacking me .
And Ben-hadad did as King Asa said, and sent the captains of his armies against the towns of Israel, attacking Ijon and Dan and Abel-maim, and all the store-towns of Naphtali.
Then Baasha, hearing of it, put a stop to the building of Ramah, and let his work come to an end.
Then King Asa, with all Judah, took away the stones and wood with which Baasha was building Ramah, and he made use of them for building Geba and Mizpah.
At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa , king of Judah , and said to him , Because you have put your faith in the king of Aram and not in the Lord your God , the army of the king of Aram has got away out of
your hands .
Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a very great army, with war-carriages and horsemen more than might be numbered? but because your faith was in the Lord, he gave them up into your hands.
For the eyes of the Lord go this way and that , through all the earth , letting it be seen that he is the strong support of those whose hearts are true to him . In this you have done foolishly , for from now you will have wars
Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in prison, burning with wrath against him because of this thing. And at the same time Asa was cruel to some of the people.
Now the acts of Asa, first and last, are recorded in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
In the thirty-ninth year of his rule, Asa had a very bad disease of the feet; but he did not go to the Lord for help in his disease, but to medical men.
So Asa went to rest with his fathers, and death came to him in the forty-first year of his rule.
And they put him into the resting-place which he had made for himself in the town of David, in a bed full of sweet perfumes of all sorts of spices, made by the perfumer's art, and they made a great burning for him.
And Jehoshaphat his son became king in his place, and made himself strong against Israel.
He put forces in all the walled towns of Judah, and responsible chiefs in the land of Judah and in the towns of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.
And the Lord was with Jehoshaphat, because he went in the early ways of his father, not turning to the Baals,
But turning to the God of his father and keeping his laws, and not doing as Israel did.
So the Lord made his kingdom strong; and all Judah gave offerings to Jehoshaphat, and he had great wealth and honour.
His heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord; and he went so far as to take away the high places and the wood pillars out of Judah.
In the third year of his rule he sent Benhail and Obadiah and Zechariah and Nethanel and Micaiah, his captains, as teachers into the towns of Judah;
And with them, Shemaiah and Nethaniah and Zebadiah and Asahel and Shemiramoth and Jehonathan and Adonijah and Tobijah and Tob-adonijah, the Levites; and Elishama and Jehoram the priests.
And they gave teaching in Judah and had the book of the law of the Lord with them; they went through all the towns of Judah teaching the people.
And the fear of the Lord was on all the kingdoms of the lands round Judah, so that they made no wars against Jehoshaphat.
And some of the Philistines took offerings to Jehoshaphat, and made him payments of silver; and the Arabians gave him flocks, seven thousand, seven hundred sheep, and seven thousand, seven hundred he-goats.
Jehoshaphat became greater and greater, and made strong towers and store-towns in Judah.
He had much property in the towns of Judah; he had forces of armed men, great and strong, in Jerusalem.
This is the number of them, listed by their families, the captains of thousands of Judah: Adnah, the captain, and with him three hundred thousand men of war;
Second to him Jehohanan, the captain, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand;
After him Amasiah, the son of Zichri, who freely gave himself to the Lord, and with him two hundred thousand men of war;
And the captains of Benjamin: Eliada, a great man of war, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bows and body-covers;
And after him Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and eighty thousand trained for war.
These were the men who were waiting on the king, in addition to those placed by the king in the walled towns through all Judah.
Now Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honour, and his son was married to Ahab's daughter.
And after some years he went down to Samaria to see Ahab. And Ahab made a feast for him and the people who were with him, putting to death great numbers of sheep and oxen; and he got Jehoshaphat to go with him to Ramoth-gilead.
For Ahab, king of Israel, said to Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he said, I am as you are, and my people as your people; we will be with you in the war.
Then Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Let us now get directions from the Lord.
So the king of Israel got together all the prophets , four hundred men , and said to them , Am I to go to Ramoth-gilead to make war or not ? And they said , Go up : for God will give it into the hands of the king
But Jehoshaphat said, Is there no other prophet of the Lord here from whom we may get directions?
And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , There is still one man by whom we may get directions from the Lord , but I have no love for him , because he has never been a prophet of good to me , but only of evil : he
is Micaiah , the son of Imla . And Jehoshaphat said , Let not the king say so .
Then the king of Israel sent for one of his unsexed servants and said, Go quickly and come back with Micaiah, the son of Imla.
Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were seated on their seats of authority, dressed in their robes, by the doorway into Samaria; and all the prophets were acting as prophets before them.
And Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, made himself iron horns and said, The Lord says, Pushing back the Aramaeans with these, you will put an end to them completely.
And all the prophets said the same thing, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and it will go well for you, for the Lord will give it into the hands of the king.
Now the servant who had gone to get Micaiah said to him, See now, all the prophets with one voice are saying good things to the king; so let your words be like theirs, and say good things.
And Micaiah said, By the living Lord, whatever the Lord says to me I will say.
When he came to the king , the king said to him , Micaiah , are we to go to Ramoth-gilead to make war or not ? And he said , Go up , and it will go well for you ; and they will be given up into your
hands .
And the king said to him, Have I not, again and again, put you on your oath to say nothing to me but what is true in the name of the Lord?
Then he said, I saw all Israel wandering on the mountains like sheep without a keeper; and the Lord said, These have no master: let them go back, every man to his house in peace.
And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not say that he would not be a prophet of good to me, but of evil?
Then he said, Give ear now to the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord seated on his seat of power, and all the army of heaven in their places, at his right hand and at his left.
And the Lord said, How may Ahab, king of Israel, be tricked into going up to Ramoth-gilead to his death? And one said one thing and one another.
Then a spirit came forward and took his place before the Lord and said, I will get him to do it by a trick. And the Lord said to him, How?
And he said, I will go out and be a spirit of deceit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Your trick will have its effect on him: go out and do so.
And now, see, the Lord has put a spirit of deceit in the mouth of these prophets of yours; and the Lord has said evil against you.
Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, came near and gave Micaiah a blow on the side of his face, saying, Where is the spirit of the Lord whose word is in you?
And Micaiah said, Truly, you will see on that day when you go into an inner room to keep yourself safe.
And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon, the ruler of the town, and to Joash, the king's son;
And say, By the king's order this man is to be put in prison, and given prison food till I come back in peace.
And Micaiah said, If you come back at all in peace, the Lord has not sent his word by me.
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up to Ramoth-gilead.
And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , I will make a change in my clothing , so that I do not seem to be the king , and will go into the fight ; but do you put on your robes . So the king of Israel made
a change in his dress , and they went to the fight .
Now the king of Aram had given orders to the captains of his war-carriages, saying, Make no attack on small or great, but only on the king of Israel.
So when the captains of the war-carriages saw Jehoshaphat , they said , It is the king of Israel . And turning about , they came round him , but Jehoshaphat gave a cry , and the Lord came to his help , and God sent them away from him
Now when the captains of the war-carriages saw that he was not the king of Israel, they went back from going after him.
And a certain man sent an arrow from his bow without thought of its direction , and gave the king of Israel a wound where his breastplate was joined to his clothing ; so he said to the driver of his war-carriage , Go to one side and take me
away out of the army , for I am badly wounded .
But the fight became more violent while the day went on; and the king of Israel was supported in his war-carriage facing the Aramaeans till the evening; and by sundown he was dead.
And Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, went back to his house in Jerusalem in peace.
And Jehu , the son of Hanani the seer , went to King Jehoshaphat and said to him , Is it right for you to go to the help of evil-doers , loving the haters of the Lord ? because of this , the wrath of the Lord has come
on you .
But still there is some good in you, for you have put away the wood pillars out of the land, and have given your heart to the worship of God.
And Jehoshaphat was living in Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people, from Beer-sheba to the hill-country of Ephraim, guiding them back to the Lord, the God of their fathers.
And he put judges through all the land, in every walled town of Judah,
And said to the judges, Take care what you do, for you are judging not for man but for the Lord, and he is with you in the decisions you give.
So now let the fear of the Lord be in you; do your work with care; for in the Lord our God there is no evil, or respect for high position, or taking of payment to do wrong.
Then in Jerusalem he gave authority to certain of the Levites and the priests and the heads of families of Israel to give decisions for the Lord, and in the causes of those living in Jerusalem.
And he gave them their orders, saying, You are to do your work in the fear of the Lord, in good faith and with a true heart.
And if any cause comes before you from your brothers living in their towns , where the death punishment is in question , or where there are questions of law or order , or rules or decisions , make them take care that they are not in the wrong before
the Lord , so that wrath may not come on you and on your brothers ; do this and you yourselves will not be in the wrong .
And now , Amariah , the chief priest , is over you in all questions to do with the Lord ; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael , the head of the family of Judah , in everything to do with the king ' s business ; and the Levites
will be overseers for you . Be strong to do the work ; and may the Lord be with the upright .
Now it was Solomon's purpose to put up a house for the name of the Lord and a house for himself as king.
And Solomon had seventy thousand men numbered for transport, and eighty thousand for cutting stone in the mountains, and three thousand, six hundred as overseers.
And Solomon sent to Huram, king of Tyre, saying, As you did for my father David, sending him cedar-trees for the building of his house,
See ! I am building a house for the name of the Lord my God , to be made holy to him , where perfumes of sweet spices will be burned before him , and the holy bread will be placed at all times , and burned offerings will be
offered morning and evening , on the Sabbaths and at the new moons , and on the regular feasts of the Lord our God . This is a law for ever to Israel .
And the house which I am building is to be great, for our God is greater than all gods.
But who may have strength enough to make a house for him , seeing that the heaven and the heaven of heavens are not wide enough to be his resting-place ? who am I then to make a house for him ? But I am building it only for the
burning of perfume before him .
So now send me an expert worker in gold and silver and brass and iron ? in purple and red and blue , and in the cutting of all sorts of ornament , to be with the expert workmen who are here in Judah and in Jerusalem , whom my
father David got together .
And send me cedar-trees, cypress-trees and sandal-wood from Lebanon, for, to my knowledge, your servants are expert wood-cutters in Lebanon; and my servants will be with yours,
To get trees for me in great numbers, for the house which I am building is to be great and a wonder.
And I will give as food to your servants, the wood-cutters, twenty thousand measures of grain, and twenty thousand measures of barley and twenty thousand measures of wine and twenty thousand measures of oil.
Then Huram, king of Tyre, sent Solomon an answer in writing, saying, Because of his love for his people the Lord has made you king over them.
And Huram said , Praise be to the Lord , the God of Israel , maker of heaven and earth , who has given to David the king a wise son , full of wisdom and good sense , to be the builder of a house for the Lord and
a house for himself as king .
And now I am sending you a wise and expert man, Huram who is as my father,
The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan , whose father was a man of Tyre , an expert worker in gold and silver and brass and iron , in stone and wood , in purple and blue and fair linen and red , trained in the cutting
of every sort of ornament and the invention of every sort of design ; let him be given a place among your expert workmen and those of my lord , your father David .
So now let my lord send to his servants the grain and the oil and the wine as my lord has said;
And we will have wood cut from Lebanon, as much as you have need of, and will send it to you on flat boats by sea to Joppa, and from there you may take it up to Jerusalem.
Then Solomon took the number of all the men from strange lands who were living in Israel, as his father David had done; there were a hundred and fifty-three thousand, six hundred.
Seventy thousand he put to the work of transport, eighty thousand to cutting stone in the mountains, and three thousand, six hundred as overseers to put the people to work.
Now after this, the children of Moab and the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Meunim, made war against Jehoshaphat.
And they came to Jehoshaphat with the news, saying, A great army is moving against you from Edom across the sea; and now they are in Hazazon-tamar (which is En-gedi).
Then Jehoshaphat, in his fear, went to the Lord for directions, and gave orders all through Judah for the people to go without food.
And Judah came together to make prayer for help from the Lord; from every town of Judah they came to give worship to the Lord.
And Jehoshaphat took his place in the meeting of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord in front of the new open space,
And said , O Lord , the God of our fathers , are you not God in heaven ? are you not ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations ? and in your hands are power and strength so that no one is able to keep his place against
you .
Did you not, O Lord our God, after driving out the people of this land before your people Israel, give it to the seed of Abraham, your friend, for ever?
And they made it their living-place, building there a holy house for your name, and saying,
If evil comes on us , the sword , or punishment , or disease , or need of food , we will come to this house and to you , ( for your name is in this house , ) crying to you in our trouble , and you will
give us salvation in answer to our cry .
And now, see, the children of Ammon and Moab and the people of Mount Seir, whom you kept Israel from attacking when they came out of Egypt, so that turning to one side they did not send destruction on them:
See now, how as our reward they have come to send us out of your land which you have given us as our heritage.
O our God, will you not be their judge? for our strength is not equal to this great army which is coming against us; and we are at a loss what to do: but our eyes are on you.
And all Judah were waiting before the Lord, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.
Then, before all the meeting, the spirit of the Lord came on Jahaziel, the son of Zechariah, son of Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah, a Levite and one of the family of Asaph;
And he said , Give ear , O Judah , and you people of Jerusalem , and you , King Jehoshaphat : the Lord says to you , Have no fear and do not be troubled on account of this great army ; for the fight is not yours but
God ' s .
Go down against them tomorrow: see, they are coming up by the slope of Ziz; at the end of the valley, before the waste land of Jeruel, you will come face to face with them.
There will be no need for you to take up arms in this fight ; put yourselves in position , and keep where you are , and you will see the salvation of the Lord with you , O Judah and Jerusalem : have no fear and do not be
troubled : go out against them tomorrow , for the Lord is with you .
Then Jehoshaphat went down with his face to the earth, and all Judah and the people of Jerusalem gave worship to the Lord, falling down before him.
And the Levites, the children of the Kohathites and the Korahites, got to their feet and gave praise to the Lord, the God of Israel, with a loud voice.
And early in the morning they got up and went out to the waste land of Tekoa : and when they were going out , Jehoshaphat took his station and said to them , Give ear to me , O Judah and you people of Jerusalem : have faith in
the Lord your God and you will be safe ; have faith in his prophets and all will go well for you .
And after discussion with the people , he put in their places those who were to make melody to the Lord , praising him in holy robes , while they went at the head of the army , and saying , May the Lord be praised , for his mercy
is unchanging for ever .
And at the first notes of song and praise the Lord sent a surprise attack against the children of Ammon and Moab and the people of Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were overcome.
And the children of Ammon and Moab made an attack on the people of Mount Seir with a view to their complete destruction; and when they had put an end to the people of Seir, everyman's hand was turned against his neighbour for his destruction.
And Judah came to the watchtower of the waste land, and looking in the direction of the army, they saw only dead bodies stretched on the earth; no living man was to be seen.
And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their goods from them , they saw beasts in great numbers , and wealth and clothing and things of value , more than they were able to take away ; all this they took for themselves , and they were three
days getting it away , there was so much .
On the fourth day they all came together in the Valley of Blessing, and there they gave blessing to the Lord; for which cause that place has been named the Valley of Blessing to this day.
Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem went back, with Jehoshaphat at their head, coming back to Jerusalem with joy; for the Lord had made them glad over their haters.
So they came to Jerusalem with corded instruments and wind-instruments into the house of the Lord.
And the fear of God came on all the kingdoms of the lands, when they had news of how the Lord made war on those who came against Israel.
So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for the Lord gave him rest on every side.
And Jehoshaphat was king over Judah: he was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he was ruling for twenty-five years in Jerusalem: his mother's name was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.
He went in the ways of his father Asa, not turning away, but doing right in the eyes of the Lord.
The high places, however, were not taken away, and the hearts of the people were still not true to the God of their fathers.
Now as for the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, they are recorded in the words of Jehu, the son of Hanani, which were put in the book of the kings of Israel.
After this Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, became friends with Ahaziah, king of Israel, who did much evil:
Together they made ships to go to Tarshish, building them in Ezion-geber.
Then the word of Eliezer the prophet , the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah , came against Jehoshaphat , saying , Because you have let yourself be joined with Ahaziah , the Lord has sent destruction on your works . And the ships were broken and were not able to
go to Tarshish .
And Jehoshaphat went to rest with his fathers, and his body was put into the earth in the town of David. And Jehoram his son became king in his place.
And he had brothers, sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were sons of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel.
And their father gave them much silver and gold and things of great value, as well as walled towns in Judah; but the kingdom he gave to Jehoram, because he was the oldest.
Now when Jehoram had taken his place over his father's kingdom, and had made his position safe, he put all his brothers to death with the sword, as well as some of the princes of Israel.
Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king; and he was ruling in Jerusalem for eight years.
He went in the ways of the kings of Israel, and did as the family of Ahab did, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife; and he did evil in the eyes of the Lord.
But it was not the Lord's purpose to send destruction on the family of David, because of the agreement he had made with David, when he said he would give to him and to his sons a light for ever.
In his time Edom made themselves free from the rule of Judah, and took a king for themselves.
Then Jehoram went over with his captains and all his war-carriages ... made an attack by night on the Edomites, whose forces were all round him ... on the captains of the war-carriages.
So Edom made themselves free from the rule of Judah, to this day: and at the same time Libnah made itself free from his rule; because he was turned away from the Lord, the God of his fathers.
And more than this, he made high places in the mountains of Judah, teaching the people of Jerusalem to go after false gods, and guiding Judah away from the true way.
And a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, The Lord, the God of your father David, says, Because you have not kept to the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or the ways of Asa, king of Judah,
But have gone in the way of the kings of Israel , and have made Judah and the people of Jerusalem go after false gods , as the family of Ahab did : and because you have put to death your father ' s sons , your brothers , who
were better than yourself :
Now, truly, the Lord will send a great destruction on your people and your children and your wives and everything which is yours:
And you yourself will undergo the cruel pains of a disease in your stomach, so that day by day your inside will be falling out because of the disease.
Then the Philistines and the Arabians, who are by Ethiopia, were moved by the Lord to make war on Jehoram;
And they came up against Judah, forcing a way into it, and took away all the goods in the king's house, as well as his sons and his wives; so that he had no son but only Jehoahaz, the youngest.
And after all this the Lord sent on him a disease of the stomach from which it was impossible for him to be made well.
And time went on, and after two years, his inside falling out because of the disease, he came to his death in cruel pain. And his people made no burning for him like the burning made for his fathers.
He was thirty-two years old when he became king , and he was ruling in Jerusalem for eight years : and at his death he was not regretted ; they put his body into the earth in the town of David , but not in the resting-place of the kings
And the people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place, for the band of men who came with the Arabians to the army had put all the older sons to death. So Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, became king.
Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for one year. His mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri.
He went in the ways of the family of Ahab, for his mother was his teacher in evil-doing.
And he did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as the family of Ahab did; for after the death of his father they were his guides to his destruction.
Acting on their suggestion, he went with Jehoram, son of Ahab, king of Israel, to make war on Hazael, king of Aram, at Ramoth-gilead: and Joram was wounded by the bowmen.
And he went back to Jezreel to get well from the wounds which they had given him at Ramah when he was fighting against Hazael , king of Aram . And Ahaziah , the son of Jehoram , king of Judah , went down to Jezreel to see Jehoram ,
the son of Ahab , because he was ill .
Now by the purpose of God , Ahaziah ' s journey to see Jehoram was the cause of his downfall : for when he came there , he went out with Jehoram against Jehu , the son of Nimshi , who had been marked out by the Lord for the
destruction of the family of Ahab .
Now when Jehu was effecting the punishment of the family of Ahab, he came to the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's brothers, the servants of Ahaziah, and put them to death.
And he went in search of Ahaziah ; and when they came where he was , ( for he was in a secret place in Samaria , ) they took him to Jehu and put him to death ; then they put his body to rest in the earth ,
for they said , He is the son of Jehoshaphat , whose heart was true to the Lord . So the family of Ahaziah had no power to keep the kingdom .
Now when Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, saw that her son was dead, she had all the rest of the seed of the kingdom of Judah put to death.
But Jehoshabeath , the daughter of the king , secretly took Joash , the son of Ahaziah , away from among the king ' s sons who were put to death , and put him and the woman who took care of him in a bedroom . So Jehoshabeath ,
the daughter of King Jehoram , the wife of Jehoiada the priest and sister of Ahaziah , kept him safe from Athaliah , so that she did not put him to death .
And she kept him safe with her in the house of God for six years, while Athaliah was ruling the land.
In the seventh year , Jehoiada made himself strong , and made an agreement with the captains of hundreds , Azariah , the son of Jeroham , Ishmael , the son of Jehohanan , Azariah , the son of Obed , Maaseiah , the son of Adaiah , and Elishaphat
, the son of Zichri .
And they went through Judah, getting together the Levites and the heads of families in Israel from all the towns of Judah, and they came to Jerusalem.
And all the people made an agreement with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, Truly, the king's son will be king, as the Lord has said about the sons of David.
This is what you are to do: let a third of you, of the priests and Levites, who come in on the Sabbath, keep the doors;
And a third are to be stationed at the king's house; and a third at the doorway of the horses: while all the people are waiting in the open spaces round the house of the Lord.
But let no one come into the house of the Lord but only the priests and those of the Levites who have work to do there ; they may go in for they are holy ; but the rest of the people are to keep the orders of the Lord
And the Levites are to make a circle round the king, every man being armed; and any man who comes into the house is to be put to death; you are to keep with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.
So the Levites and all Judah did as Jehoiada the priest had given them orders: every one took with him his men, those who were to come in and those who were to go out on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada had not sent away the divisions.
Then Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and body-covers which had been King David's and which were kept in the house of God.
And he put all the people in position, every man with his instruments of war in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left, by the altar and the house and all round the king.
Then they made the king's son come out, and they put the crown on his head and gave him the arm-bands and made him king: and Jehoiada and his sons put the holy oil on him and said, Long life to the king.
Now Athaliah, hearing the noise of the people running and praising the king, came to the people in the house of the Lord:
And looking , she saw the king in his place by the pillar at the doorway , and the captains and the horns by his side ; and all the people of the land were giving signs of joy and sounding the horns ; and the makers of melody were
playing on instruments of music , taking the chief part in the song of praise . Then Athaliah , violently parting her robes , said , Broken faith , broken faith !
Then Jehoiada the priest gave orders to the captains of hundreds who had authority over the army , saying , Take her outside the lines , and let anyone who goes after her be put to death with the sword . For the priest said , Let her not be
put to death in the house of the Lord .
So they put their hands on her, and she went to the king's house by the doorway of the king's horses; and there she was put to death.
And Jehoiada made an agreement between the Lord and all the people and the king, that they would be the Lord's people.
Then all the people went to the house of Baal and had it pulled down, and its altars and images broken up; and Mattan, the priest of Baal, they put to death before the altars.
And Jehoiada put the work and the care of the house of the Lord into the hands of the priests and the Levites , who had been grouped in divisions by David to make burned offerings to the Lord , as it is recorded in the law of Moses ,
with joy and song as David had said .
And he put door-keepers at the doors of the Lord's house, to see that no one who was unclean in any way might come in.
Then he took the captains of hundreds and the chiefs and the rulers of the people and all the people of the land , and they came down with the king from the house of the Lord through the higher doorway into the king ' s house , and put
the king on the seat of the kingdom .
So all the people of the land were glad and the town was quiet, for they had put Athaliah to death with the sword.
Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he was ruling for forty years in Jerusalem: his mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.
And Joash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord as long as Jehoiada the priest was living.
And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he became the father of sons and daughters.
Now after this Joash had a desire to put the house of the Lord into good order again;
And getting together the priests and Levites , he said to them , Go out into the towns of Judah year by year , and get from all Israel money to keep the house of your God in good condition ; and see that this is done without loss of
time . The Levites , however , were slow in doing so .
Then the king sent for Jehoiada , the chief priest , and said to him , Why have you not given the Levites orders that the tax fixed by Moses , the servant of the Lord , and by the meeting of Israel , for the Tent of witness ,
is to be got in from Judah and Jerusalem and handed over ?
For the house of the Lord had been broken up by Athaliah, that evil woman, and her sons; and all its holy things they had given to the Baals.
So at the king's order they made a chest and put it outside the doorway of the house of the Lord.
And an order was sent out through all Judah and Jerusalem that payment was to be made to the Lord of the tax which Moses, the servant of God, had put on Israel in the waste land.
And all the chiefs and all the people came gladly and put their money into the chest, till they had all given.
So when the chest was taken to the king ' s servants by the Levites , and they saw that there was much money in it , the king ' s scribe and the chief priest ' s servant took the money out , and put the chest back in
its place . They did this day by day , and got together a great amount of money .
Then the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who were responsible for getting the work done on the Lord's house, and with it they got wall-builders and woodworkers and metal-workers to put the house of the Lord in good order again.
So the workmen did their work, making good what was damaged and building up the house of God till it was strong and beautiful again.
And when the work was done , they took the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada , and it was used for making the vessels for the house of the Lord , all the vessels needed for the offerings , the spoons and the vessels of gold
and silver . And as long as Jehoiada was living , the regular burned offerings were offered in the house of the Lord .
But Jehoiada became old and full of days, and he came to his end; he was a hundred and thirty years old at the time of his death.
And they put him into his last resting-place in the town of David, among the kings, because he had done good in Israel for God and for his house.
Now after the death of Jehoiada, the chiefs of Judah came and went down on their faces before the king. Then the king gave ear to them.
And they gave up the house of the Lord God of their fathers, and became worshippers of pillars of wood and of the images; and because of this sin of theirs, wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem.
And the Lord sent them prophets to make them come back to him; and they gave witness against them, but they would not give ear.
Then the spirit of God came on Zechariah , the son of Jehoiada the priest , and , getting up before the people , he said to them , God has said , Why do you go against the orders of the Lord , so that everything goes badly for
you ? because you have given up the Lord , he has given you up .
But when they had made a secret design against him, he was stoned with stones, by the king's order, in the outer square of the Lord's house.
So King Joash did not keep in mind how good Jehoiada his father had been to him, but put his son to death. And in the hour of his death he said, May the Lord see it and take payment!
Now in the spring, the army of the Aramaeans came up against him; they came against Judah and Jerusalem, putting to death all the great men of the people and sending all the goods they took from them to the king of Damascus.
For though the army of Aram was only a small one, the Lord gave a very great army into their hands, because they had given up the Lord, the God of their fathers. So they put into effect the punishment of Joash.
And when they had gone away from him , ( for he was broken with disease , ) his servants made a secret design against him because of the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest , and they put him to death on his bed ; and they
put his body into the earth in the town of David , but not in the resting-place of the kings .
Those who made designs against him were Zabad, the son of Shimeath, an Ammonite woman, and Jehozabad, the son of Shimrith, a Moabite woman.
Now the story of his sons , and all the words said by the prophet against him , and the building up again of the Lord ' s house , are recorded in the account in the book of the kings . And Amaziah his son became king in his
place .
Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years; his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, but his heart was not completely true to the Lord.
Now when he became strong in the kingdom, he put to death those men who had taken the life of the king his father.
But he did not put their children to death , for he kept the orders of the Lord recorded in the book of the law of Moses , saying , The fathers are not to be put to death for their children or the children for their fathers , but
a man is to be put to death for the sin which he himself has done .
Then Amaziah got all Judah together and put them in order by their families , even all Judah and Benjamin , under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds : and he had those of twenty years old and over numbered , and they came to three hundred thousand of
the best fighting-men , trained for war and in the use of the spear and the body-cover .
And for a hundred talents of silver, he got a hundred thousand fighting-men from Israel.
But a man of God came to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with you; for the Lord is not with Israel, that is, the children of Ephraim.
But go yourself, and be strong in war; God will not let you go down before those who are fighting against you; for God has power to give help or to send you down before your attackers.
Then Amaziah said to the man of God, But what is to be done about the hundred talents which I have given for the armed band of Israel? And the man of God in answer said, God is able to give you much more than this.
So Amaziah, separating the armed band which had come to him from Ephraim, sent them back again; which made them very angry with Judah, and they went back burning with wrath.
Then Amaziah took heart, and went out at the head of his people and came to the Valley of Salt, where he put to death ten thousand of the children of Seir;
And ten thousand more the children of Israel took living, and made them go up to the top of the rock, pushing them down from the top of the rock so that their bodies were broken by the fall.
But the men of the band which Amaziah sent back and did not take with him to the fight, made attacks on the towns of Judah from Samaria to Beth-horon, putting to death three thousand of their people and taking away a great store of their goods.
Now when Amaziah came back from the destruction of the Edomites, he took the gods of the children of Seir and made them his gods, worshipping them and burning offerings before them.
And so the wrath of the Lord was moved against Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him, who said, Why have you gone after the gods of the people who have not given their people salvation from your hands?
But while he was talking to him the king said to him , Have we made you one of the king ' s government ? say no more , or it will be the cause of your death . Then the prophet gave up protesting , and said , It
is clear to me that God ' s purpose is your destruction , because you have done this and have not given ear to my words .
Then Amaziah, king of Judah, acting on the suggestion of his servants, sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us have a meeting face to face.
And Joash , king of Israel , sent to Amaziah , king of Judah , saying , The thorn-tree in Lebanon sent to the cedar in Lebanon , saying , Give your daughter to my son for a wife : and a beast from the woodland in Lebanon went by
, crushing the thorn under his feet .
You say, See, I have overcome Edom; and your heart is lifted up with pride: now keep in your country; why do you make causes of trouble, putting yourself, and Judah with you, in danger of downfall?
But Amaziah gave no attention; and this was the purpose of God, so that he might give them up into the hands of Joash, because they had gone after the gods of Edom.
And so Joash, king of Israel, went up; and he and Amaziah, king of Judah, came face to face at Beth-shemesh in Judah.
And Judah was overcome before Israel, and they went in flight, every man to his tent.
And Joash , king of Israel , made Amaziah , king of Judah , the son of Joash , the son of Jehoahaz , prisoner at Beth-shemesh , and took him to Jerusalem ; and he had the wall of Jerusalem pulled down from the doorway of Ephraim to the
doorway in the angle , four hundred cubits .
And he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels which were in the house of the Lord , under the care of Obed-edom , and all the wealth from the king ' s house , as well as those whose lives would be the price of broken
faith , and went back to Samaria .
Amaziah, son of Joash, king of Judah, went on living for fifteen years after the death of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.
Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, are they not recorded in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
Now from the time when Amaziah gave up worshipping the Lord, they made secret designs against him in Jerusalem; and he went in flight to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him and put him to death there.
And they took his body on horseback and put it into the earth with his fathers in the town of David.
Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
He was the builder of Eloth, which he got back for Judah after the death of the king.
Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for fifty-two years; his mother's name was Jechiliah of Jerusalem.
He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Amaziah had done.
He gave himself to searching after God in the days of Zechariah, who made men wise in the fear of God; and as long as he was true to the Lord, God made things go well for him.
He went out and made war against the Philistines, pulling down the walls of Gath and Jabneh and Ashdod, and building towns in the country round Ashdod and among the Philistines.
And God gave him help against the Philistines, and against the Arabians living in Gur-baal, and against the Meunim.
The Ammonites gave offerings to Uzziah: and news of him went out as far as the limit of Egypt; for he became very great in power.
Uzziah made towers in Jerusalem, at the doorway in the angle and at the doorway in the valley and at the turn of the wall, arming them.
And he put up towers in the waste land and made places for storing water , for he had much cattle , in the low hills and in the table land ; and he had farmers and vine-keepers in the mountains and in the fertile land , for he was
a lover of farming .
In addition, Uzziah had an army of fighting-men who went out to war in bands, as they had been listed by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the authority of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.
The heads of families, the strong men of war, were two thousand, six hundred.
And under their orders was a trained army of three hundred and seven thousand, five hundred, of great strength in war, helping the king against any who came against him.
And Uzziah had all these forces armed with body-covers and spears and head-covers and coats of metal and bows and stones for sending from leather bands.
And in Jerusalem he made machines, the invention of expert men, to be placed on the towers and angles of the walls for sending arrows and great stones. And his name was honoured far and wide; for he was greatly helped till he was strong.
But when he had become strong, his heart was lifted up in pride, causing his destruction; and he did evil against the Lord his God; for he went into the Temple of the Lord for the purpose of burning perfumes on the altar of perfumes.
And Azariah the priest went in after him, with eighty of the Lord's priests, who were strong men;
And they made protests to Uzziah the king , and said to him , The burning of perfumes , Uzziah , is not your business but that of the priests , the sons of Aaron , who have been made holy for this work : go out of the holy
place , for you have done wrong , and it will not be to your honour before God .
Then Uzziah was angry ; and he had in his hand a vessel for burning perfume ; and while his wrath was bitter against the priests , the mark of the leper ' s disease came out on his brow , before the eyes of the priests in the house
of the Lord by the altar of perfumes .
And Azariah , the chief priest , and all the priests , looking at him , saw the mark of the leper on his brow , and they sent him out quickly and he himself went out straight away , for the Lord ' s punishment had come on him
So King Uzziah was a leper till the day of his death, living separately in his private house; for he was cut off from the house of God; and Jotham his son was ruling over his house, judging the people of the land.
Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, were recorded by Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.
So Uzziah went to rest with his fathers; and they put his body into the earth in the field used for the resting-place of the kings, for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son became king in his place.
Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king; and he was ruling in Jerusalem for sixteen years; and his mother's name was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.
He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Uzziah had done; but he did not go into the Temple of the Lord. And the people still went on in their evil ways.
He put up the higher doorway of the house of the Lord, and did much building on the wall of the Ophel.
In addition, he made towns in the hill-country of Judah, and strong buildings and towers in the woodlands.
He went to war with the king of the children of Ammon and overcame them . That year , the children of Ammon gave him a hundred talents of silver , and ten thousand measures of grain and ten thousand measures of barley . And the children of Ammon gave
him the same amount the second year and the third .
So Jotham became strong, because in all his ways he made the Lord his guide.
Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for sixteen years.
And Jotham went to rest with his fathers, and they put his body into the earth in the town of David; and Ahaz his son became king in his place.
Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for sixteen years; he did not do what was right in the eyes of the Lord, like David his father:
But he went in the ways of the kings of Israel and made images of metal for the Baals.
More than this, he had offerings burned in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and made his children go through fire, copying the disgusting ways of the nations whom the Lord had sent out of the land before the children of Israel.
And he made offerings and had perfumes burned in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.
So the Lord his God gave him up into the hands of the king of Aram ; and they overcame him , and took away a great number of his people as prisoners to Damascus . Then he was given into the hands of the king of Israel , who
sent great destruction on him .
For Pekah, the son of Remaliah, in one day put to death a hundred and twenty thousand men of Judah, all of them good fighting-men; because they had given up the Lord, the God of their fathers.
And Zichri, a great fighting-man of Ephraim, put to death Maaseiah, the king's son, and Azrikam, the controller of his house, and Elkanah, who was second in authority to the king.
And the children of Israel took away as prisoners from their brothers, two hundred thousand, women and sons and daughters, and a great store of their goods, and took them to Samaria.
But a prophet of the Lord was there , named Oded ; and he went out in front of the army which was coming into Samaria and said to them , Truly , because the Lord , the God of your fathers , was angry with Judah , he gave
them up into your hands , and you have put them to death in an outburst of wrath stretching up to heaven .
And now your purpose is to keep the children of Judah and Jerusalem as men-servants and women-servants under your yoke: but are there no sins against the Lord your God to be seen among yourselves?
And now give ear to me, and send back the prisoners whom you have taken from your brothers: for the wrath of the Lord is burning against you.
Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah, the son of Johanan, Berechiah, the son of Meshillemoth Jehizkiah, the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, put themselves against those who had come from the war,
And said to them , You are not to let these prisoners come here ; for what you are designing to do will be a cause of sin against the Lord to us , making even greater our sin and our wrongdoing , which now are great enough , and
his wrath is burning against Israel .
So the armed men gave up the prisoners and the goods they had taken to the heads and the meeting of the people.
And those men who have been named went up and took the prisoners , clothing those among them who were uncovered , with things from the goods which had been taken in the war , and putting robes on them and shoes on their feet ; and they gave them
food and drink and oil for their bodies , and seating all the feeble among them on asses , they took them to Jericho , the town of palm-trees , to their people , and then went back to Samaria .
At that time King Ahaz sent for help to the king of Assyria.
For the Edomites had come again, attacking Judah and taking away prisoners.
And the Philistines, forcing their way into the towns of the lowlands and the south of Judah, had taken Beth-shemesh and Aijalon and Gederoth and Soco, with their daughter-towns, as well as Timnah and Gimzo and their daughter-towns, and were living there.
For the Lord made Judah low, because of Ahaz, king of Israel; for he had given up all self-control in Judah, sinning greatly against the Lord.
Then Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria, came to him, but was a cause of trouble and not of strength to him.
For Ahaz took a part of the wealth from the house of the Lord, and from the house of the king and of the great men, and gave it to the king of Assyria; but it was no help to him.
And in the time of his trouble, this same King Ahaz did even more evil against the Lord.
For he made offerings to the gods of Damascus , who were attacking him , and said , Because the gods of the kings of Aram are giving them help , I will make offerings to them so that they may give me help . But they were the cause
of his downfall , and of that of all Israel .
And Ahaz got together the vessels of the house of God, cutting up all the vessels of the house of God, and shutting the doors of the Lord's house; and he made altars in every part of Jerusalem.
And in every town of Judah he made high places where perfumes were burned to other gods, awaking the wrath of the Lord, the God of his fathers.
Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, first and last, are recorded in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
And Ahaz went to rest with his fathers, and they put his body into the earth in Jerusalem; but they did not put him in the resting-place of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son became king in his place.
Hezekiah became king when he was twenty-five years old; and he was king in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years; and his mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done.
In the first year of his rule, in the first month, opening the doors of the Lord's house, he made them strong.
And he sent for the priests and the Levites, and got them together in the wide place on the east side,
And said to them, Give ear to me, O Levites: now make yourselves holy, and make holy the house of the Lord, the God of your fathers, and take away everything unclean from the holy place.
For our fathers have done evil, sinning in the eyes of the Lord our God, and have given him up, turning away their faces from the house of the Lord, and turning their backs on him.
The doors of his house have been shut and the lights put out; no perfumes have been burned or offerings made to the God of Israel in his holy place.
And so the wrath of the Lord has come on Judah and Jerusalem, and he has given them up to be a cause of fear and wonder and shame, as your eyes have seen.
For see, our fathers have been put to death with the sword, and our sons and daughters and wives have been taken away prisoners because of this.
Now it is my purpose to make an agreement with the Lord, the God of Israel, so that the heat of his wrath may be turned away from us.
My sons, take care now: for you have been marked out by the Lord to come before him and to be his servants, burning offerings to him.
Then the Levites took their places ; Mahath , the son of Amasai , and Joel , the son of Azariah , among the Kohathites ; and of the sons of Merari , Kish , the son of Abdi , and Azariah , the son of Jehallelel ; and of
the Gershonites , Joah , the son of Zimmah , and Eden , the son of Joah ;
And of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;
And of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
And they got their brothers together and made themselves holy, and went in, as the king had said by the word of the Lord, to make the house of the Lord clean.
And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord to make it clean , and everything unclean which was to be seen in the Temple of the Lord they took out into the outer square of the Lord ' s house , and the Levites
got it together and took it away to the stream Kidron .
On the first day of the first month the work of making the house holy was started , and on the eighth day they came to the covered way of the Lord ; in eight days they made the Lord ' s house holy , and on the sixteenth day
of the first month the work was done .
Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said, We have made all the house of the Lord clean, as well as the altar of burned offerings with all its vessels, and the table for the holy bread, with all its vessels.
And all the vessels which were turned out by King Ahaz in his sin while he was king, we have put in order and made holy, and now they are in their places before the altar of the Lord.
Then Hezekiah the king got up early, and got together the great men of the town, and went up to the house of the Lord.
And they took with them seven oxen and seven male sheep and seven lambs and seven he-goats as a sin-offering for the kingdom and for the holy house and for Judah . And he gave orders to the sons of Aaron , the priests , that these were to be
offered on the altar of the Lord .
So they put the oxen to death and their blood was given to the priests to be drained out against the altar ; then they put the male sheep to death , draining out their blood against the altar , and they put the lambs to death , draining out
their blood against the altar .
Then they took the he-goats for the sin-offering, placing them before the king and the meeting of the people, and they put their hands on them:
And the priests put them to death, and made a sin-offering with their blood on the altar, to take away the sin of all Israel: for the king gave orders that the burned offering and the sin-offering were for all Israel.
Then he put the Levites in their places in the house of the Lord , with brass and corded instruments of music as ordered by David and Gad , the king ' s seer , and Nathan the prophet : for the order was the Lord ' s , given
by his prophets .
So the Levites took their places with David's instruments, and the priests with their horns.
And Hezekiah gave the word for the burned offering to be offered on the altar. And when the burned offering was started, then the song of the Lord was started, with the blowing of horns and with all the instruments of David, king of Israel.
And all the people gave worship, to the sound of songs and the blowing of horns; and this went on till the burned offering was ended.
And at the end of the offering, the king and all who were present with him gave worship with bent heads.
Then King Hezekiah and the captains gave orders to the Levites to give praise to God in the words of David and Asaph the seer. And they made songs of praise with joy, and with bent heads gave worship.
Then Hezekiah made answer and said , Now that you have given yourselves to the Lord , come near and take offerings and praise-offerings into the house of the Lord . So all the people took in offerings and praise-offerings : and those whose hearts were moved , took in
burned offerings .
The number of burned offerings which the people took in was seventy oxen, a hundred male sheep, and two hundred lambs: all these were for burned offerings to the Lord.
And the holy things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
There were not enough priests for the work of cutting up all the burned offerings ; so their brothers the Levites gave them help till the work was done and the priests had made themselves holy : for the Levites were more upright in heart to make themselves holy than
the priests .
And there was a great amount of burned offerings, with the fat of the peace-offerings and the drink offerings for every burned offering. So the work of the Lord's house was put in order.
And Hezekiah and all the people were full of joy, because God had made the people ready: for the thing was done suddenly.
Then Solomon made a start at building the house of the Lord on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem, where the Lord had been seen by his father David, in the place which David had made ready in the grain-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
The building was started in the second month in the fourth year of his rule.
And Solomon put the base of the house of God in position; by the older measure it was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide.
And the covered way in front of the house was twenty cubits long, as wide as the house, and a hundred and twenty cubits high, all plated inside with the best gold.
And the greater house was roofed with cypress-wood, plated with the best gold and ornamented with designs of palm-trees and chains.
And the house was made beautiful with stones of great value, and the gold was gold of Parvaim.
All the house was plated with gold, the supports, the steps, the walls and the doors; and the walls were ornamented with designs of winged ones.
And he made the most holy place; it was twenty cubits long, and twenty cubits wide, like the greater house, and was plated all over with the best gold; six hundred talents were used for it.
And fifty shekels weight of gold was used for the nails. He had all the higher rooms plated with gold.
And in the most holy place he made images of two winged beings, covering them with gold.
Their outstretched wings were twenty cubits across; one wing, five cubits long, touching the wall of the house, and the other, of the same size, meeting the wing of the other winged one.
And in the same way, the wings of the other, five cubits long, were stretched out, one touching the wall and the other meeting the wing of the first winged one.
Their outstretched wings were twenty cubits across; they were placed upright on their feet, facing the inner part of the house.
And he made the veil of blue and purple and red, of the best linen, worked with winged ones.
And in front of the house he made two pillars, thirty-five cubits high, with crowns on the tops of them, five cubits high.
And he made chains, like neck ornaments, and put them on the tops of the pillars, and a hundred apples on the chains.
He put up the pillars in front of the Temple, one on the right side and one on the left, naming the one on the right Jachin and that on the left Boaz.
Then Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah, and sent letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, requesting them to come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover to the Lord, the God of Israel.
For the king, after discussion with his chiefs and all the body of the people in Jerusalem, had made a decision to keep the Passover in the second month.
It was not possible to keep it at that time, because not enough priests had made themselves holy, and the people had not come together in Jerusalem.
And the thing was right in the eyes of the king and all the people.
So it was ordered that word was to be sent out through all Israel , from Beer-sheba to Dan , that they were to come to keep the Passover to the Lord , the God of Israel , at Jerusalem : because they had not kept it in great numbers
in agreement with the law .
So runners went with letters from the king and his chiefs through all Israel and Judah , by the order of the king , saying , O children of Israel , come back again to the Lord , the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , so that
he may come again to that small band of you which has been kept safe out of the hands of the kings of Assyria .
Do not be like your fathers and your brothers, who were sinners against the Lord, the God of their fathers, so that he made them a cause of fear, as you see.
Now do not be hard-hearted , as your fathers were ; but give yourselves to the Lord , and come into his holy place , which he has made his for ever , and be the servants of the Lord your God , so that the heat of his wrath
may be turned away from you .
For if you come back to the Lord , those who took away your brothers and your children will have pity on them , and let them come back to this land : for the Lord your God is full of grace and mercy , and his face will not
be turned away from you if you come back to him .
So the runners went from town to town through all the country of Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun: but they were laughed at and made sport of.
However, some of Asher and Manasseh and Zebulun put away their pride and came to Jerusalem.
And in Judah the power of God gave them one heart to do the orders of the king and the captains, which were taken as the word of the Lord.
So a very great number of people came together at Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month.
And they got to work and took away all the altars in Jerusalem, and they put all the vessels for burning perfumes into the stream Kidron.
Then on the fourteenth day of the second month they put the Passover lambs to death: and the priests and the Levites were shamed, and made themselves holy and took burned offerings into the house of the Lord.
And they took their places in their right order, as it was ordered in the law of Moses, the man of God: the priests draining out on the altar the blood given them by the Levites.
For there were still a number of the people there who had not made themselves holy: so the Levites had to put Passover lambs to death for those who were not clean, to make them holy to the Lord.
For a great number of the people from Ephraim and Manasseh , Issachar and Zebulun , had not made themselves clean , but they took the Passover meal , though not in the right way . For Hezekiah had made prayer for them , saying , May the good Lord
have mercy on everyone
Who, with all his heart, is turned to God the Lord, the God of his fathers, even if he has not been made clean after the rules of the holy place.
And the Lord gave ear to Hezekiah, and made the people well.
So the children of Israel who were present in Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread for seven days with great joy: and the Levites and the priests gave praise to the Lord day by day, making melody to the Lord with loud instruments.
And Hezekiah said kind words to the Levites who were expert in the ordering of the worship of the Lord: so they kept the feast for seven days, offering peace-offerings and praising the Lord, the God of their fathers.
And by the desire of all the people, the feast went on for another seven days, and they kept the seven days with joy.
For Hezekiah, king of Judah, gave to the people for offerings, a thousand oxen and seven thousand sheep; and the rulers gave a thousand oxen and ten thousand sheep; and a great number of priests made themselves holy.
And all the people of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and those who had come from Israel, and men from other lands who had come from Israel or who were living in Judah, were glad with great joy.
So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for nothing like this had been seen in Jerusalem from the time of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel.
Then the priests and the Levites gave the people a blessing: and the voice of their prayer went up to the holy place of God in heaven.
Now when all this was over , all the men of Israel who were present went out into the towns of Judah , causing the stone pillars to be broken up and the wood pillars to be cut down , pulling down the high places and the altars in all
Judah and Benjamin , as well as in Ephraim and Manasseh , till all were gone . Then all the children of Israel went back to their towns , every man to his property .
Then Hezekiah put in order the divisions of the priests and Levites , every man in his division , in relation to his work , for the burned offerings and peace-offerings , and for the ordering of worship and for giving praise at the doors of the Lord ' s
house .
And he gave the king ' s part of his private property for the burned offerings , that is , for the morning and evening offerings , and the offerings for the Sabbath and the new moons and the regular feasts , as it is recorded in the law of
the Lord .
In addition, he gave orders to the people of Jerusalem to give to the priests and Levites that part which was theirs by right, so that they might be strong in keeping the law of the Lord.
And when the order was made public , straight away the children of Israel gave , in great amounts , the first-fruits of their grain and wine and oil and honey , and of the produce of their fields ; and they took in a tenth part of everything ,
a great store .
And the children of Israel and Judah , who were living in the towns of Judah came with the tenth part of their oxen and sheep , and a tenth of all the holy things which were to be given to the Lord their God , and put them in
great masses .
The first store of things was put down in the third month, and in the seventh month the masses were complete.
And when Hezekiah and the rulers came and saw all the store of goods, they gave praise to the Lord and to his people Israel.
Then Hezekiah put questions to the priests and Levites about the store of goods.
And Azariah , the chief priest , of the family of Zadok , said in answer , From the time when the people first came with their offerings into the house of the Lord , we have had food enough , and more than enough : for the blessing of
the Lord is on his people ; and there is this great store which has not been used .
Then Hezekiah said that store-rooms were to be made ready in the house of the Lord; and this was done.
And in them they put all the offerings and the tenths and the holy things, keeping nothing back, and over them was Conaniah the Levite, with Shimei his brother second to him.
And Jehiel and Azaziah and Nahath and Asahel and Jerimoth and Jozabad and Eliel and Ismachiah and Mahath and Benaiah were overseers , under the directions of Conaniah and Shimei his brother , by the order of Hezekiah the king and Azariah , the ruler of the house of God
And Kore, the son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the east door, had control of the offerings freely given to God, and the distribution of the offerings of the Lord and the most holy things.
And under him were Eden and Miniamin and Jeshua and Shemaiah and Amariah and Shecaniah, in the towns of the priests, who were made responsible for giving it to all their brothers, by divisions, to small and great:
As well as to all the males, of three years old and over, listed by their families, who went into the house of the Lord to do what was needed day by day, for their special work with their divisions.
And the families of the priests were listed by their fathers' names, but the Levites, of twenty years old and over, were listed in relation to their work in their divisions;
And in the lists were all their little ones and their wives and their sons and daughters, through all the people: they made themselves holy in the positions which they were given.
And as for the sons of Aaron , the priests , living in the country on the outskirts of their towns , every different town there were men , marked out by name , to give their part of the goods to all the males among the priests , and
to all who were listed among the Levites .
This Hezekiah did through all Judah; he did what was good and right and true before the Lord his God.
And for everything he undertook, in connection with the work of the house of God and his law and orders, he got directions from God and did it with serious purpose; and things went well for him.
Now after these things and this true-hearted work, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came into Judah, and put his army in position before the walled towns of Judah, designing to make his way into them by force.
And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come for the purpose of fighting against Jerusalem,
He took up with his rulers and men of war the question of stopping up the water-springs outside the town; and they gave him their support.
So they got together a great number of people, and had all the water-springs and the stream flowing through the land stopped up, saying, Why let the kings of Assyria come and have much water?
Then he took heart , building up the wall where it was broken down , and making its towers higher , and building another wall outside ; and he made strong the Millo in the town of David , and got together a great store of all sorts of instruments
of war .
And he put war chiefs over the people, and sent for them all to come together to him in the wide place at the doorway into the town, and to give them heart he said to them,
Be strong and take heart; have no fear, and do not be troubled on account of the king of Assyria and all the great army with him: for there is a greater with us.
With him is an arm of flesh; but we have the Lord our God, helping us and fighting for us. And the people put their faith in what Hezekiah, king of Judah, said.
After this, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, sent his servants to Jerusalem (at that time he was stationed with all his army in front of Lachish), to say to Hezekiah and all the men of Judah in Jerusalem,
Sennacherib, king of Assyria, says, In what are you placing your hope, waiting here in the walled town of Jerusalem?
Is it not Hezekiah who has got you to do it, causing your death from need of food and water, by saying, The Lord our God will give us salvation out of the hands of the king of Assyria?
Has not this same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, Give worship before one altar only, burning offerings on it?
Have you no knowledge of what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of every land? were the gods of the nations of those lands able to keep their land from falling into my hands?
Who was there among all the gods of those nations, which my fathers put to destruction, who was able to keep his people safe from my hands? and is it possible that your God will keep you safe from my hands?
So do not be tricked by Hezekiah or let him get you to do this , and do not put any faith in what he says : for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to keep his people safe from my hands , or the hands
of my fathers : how much less will your God keep you safe from my hands !
And his servants said even more against the Lord God and against his servant Hezekiah.
And he sent letters , in addition , to put shame on the Lord , the God of Israel , and to say evil against him , saying , As the gods of the nations of other lands have not been able to keep their people safe from my hands
, no more will the God of Hezekiah keep his people safe from my hands .
These things they said, crying out with a loud voice in the Jews' language, to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, with the purpose of troubling them and putting fear into them, so that they might take the town;
Talking of the God of Jerusalem as if he was like the gods of the peoples of the earth, the work of men's hands.
And Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, made prayer because of this, crying out to heaven.
And the Lord sent an angel who put to death all the men of war and the chiefs and the captains in the army of the king of Assyria . So he went back to his country in shame . And when he came into the house of his god
, his sons , the offspring of his body , put him to death there with the sword .
So the Lord gave Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem salvation from the power of Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, and from all others, giving them rest on every side.
And great numbers came to Jerusalem with offerings for the Lord, and things of great price for Hezekiah, king of Judah: so that he was honoured among all nations from that time.
In those days Hezekiah was ill and near death; and he made prayer to the Lord, and the Lord in answer gave him a sign.
But Hezekiah did not do as had been done to him; for his heart was lifted up in pride; and so wrath came on him and on Judah and Jerusalem.
But then, Hezekiah, in sorrow for what he had done, put away his pride; and he and all Jerusalem made themselves low, so that the wrath of the Lord did not come on them in Hezekiah's life-time.
And Hezekiah had very great wealth and honour; and he made himself store-houses for his gold and silver and jewels and spices, and for body-covers and all sorts of beautiful vessels.
And store-houses for the produce of grain and wine and oil; and buildings for all sorts of beasts and flocks.
And he made towns for himself, and got together much property in flocks and herds: for God had given him great wealth.
It was Hezekiah who had the higher spring of the water of Gihon stopped, and the water taken down on the west side of the town of David. In everything he undertook, Hezekiah did well.
However, in the business of the representatives sent by the rulers of Babylon to get news of the wonder which had taken place in the land, God gave up guiding him, testing him to see what was in his heart.
Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and the good he did, are recorded in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
So Hezekiah went to rest with his fathers , and they put his body into the higher part of the resting-places of the sons of David : and all Judah and the people of Jerusalem gave him honour at his death . And Manasseh his son became king in his
place .
Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he was ruling for fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, copying the disgusting ways of the nations whom the Lord had sent out of the land before the children of Israel.
For he put up again the high places which had been pulled down by his father Hezekiah; and he made altars for the Baals, and pillars of wood, and was a worshipper and servant of all the stars of heaven;
And he made altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord had said, In Jerusalem will my name be for ever.
And he made altars for all the stars of heaven in the two outer squares of the house of the Lord.
More than this , he made his children go through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom ; and he made use of secret arts , and signs for reading the future , and unnatural powers , and gave positions to those who had control of spirits
and to wonder-workers : he did much evil in the eyes of the Lord , moving him to wrath .
And he put the image he had made in the house of God , the house of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son , In this house , and in Jerusalem , the town which I have made mine out of all the tribes of
Israel , will I put my name for ever :
And never again will I let the feet of Israel be moved out of the land which I have given to their fathers ; if only they will take care to do all my orders , even all the law and the orders and the rules given to them by
Moses .
And Manasseh made Judah and the people of Jerusalem go out of the true way, so that they did more evil than those nations whom the Lord gave up to destruction before the children of Israel.
And the word of the Lord came to Manasseh and his people, but they gave no attention.
So the Lord sent against them the captains of the army of Assyria, who made Manasseh a prisoner and took him away in chains to Babylon.
And crying out to the Lord his God in his trouble, he made himself low before the God of his fathers,
And made prayer to him; and in answer to his prayer God let him come back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh was certain that the Lord was God.
After this he made an outer wall for the town of David , on the west side of Gihon in the valley , as far as the way into the town by the fish doorway ; and he put a very high wall round the Ophel ; and he put
captains of the army in all the walled towns of Judah .
He took away the strange gods and the image out of the house of the Lord, and all the altars he had put up on the hill of the Lord's house and in Jerusalem, and put them out of the town.
And he put the altar of the Lord in order, offering peace-offerings and praise-offerings on it, and said that all Judah were to be servants of the Lord, the God of Israel.
However, the people still made offerings in the high places, but only to the Lord their God.
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words which the seers said to him in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, are recorded among the acts of the kings of Israel.
And the prayer which he made to God , and how God gave him an answer , and all his sin and his wrongdoing , and the places where he made high places and put up pillars of wood and images , before he put away his pride , are
recorded in the history of the seers .
So Manasseh went to rest with his fathers, and they put his body to rest in his house, and Amon his son became king in his place.
Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king; and he was ruling for two years in Jerusalem.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as Manasseh his father had done; and Amon made offerings to all the images which his father Manasseh had made, and was their servant.
He did not make himself low before the Lord, as his father Manasseh had done, but went on sinning more and more.
And his servants made a secret design against him, and put him to death in his house.
But the people of the land put to death all those who had taken part in the design against King Amon, and made his son Josiah king in his place.
Josiah was eight years old when he became king; he was ruling in Jerusalem for thirty-one years.
And he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, walking in the ways of his father David, without turning to the right hand or to the left.
In the eighth year of his rule , while he was still young , his heart was first turned to the God of his father David ; and in the twelfth year he undertook the clearing away of all the high places and the pillars and the images of wood
and metal from Judah and Jerusalem .
He had the altars of the Baals broken down , while he himself was present ; and the sun-images which were placed on high over them he had cut down ; and the pillars of wood and the metal images he had broken up and crushed to dust , dropping
the dust over the resting-places of the dead who had made offerings to them .
And he had the bones of the priests burned on their altars, and so he made Judah and Jerusalem clean.
And in all the towns of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon as far as Naphtali, he made waste their houses round about.
He had the altars and the pillars of wood pulled down and the images crushed to dust, and all the sun-images cut down, through all the land of Israel, and then he went back to Jerusalem.
Now in the eighteenth year of his rule , when the land and the house had been made clean , he sent Shaphan , the son of Azaliah , and Maaseiah , the ruler of the town , and Joah , the son of Joahaz , the recorder , to
make good what was damaged in the house of the Lord his God .
And they came to Hilkiah , the chief priest , and gave him all the money which had been taken into the house of God , which the Levites , the keepers of the door , had got from Manasseh and Ephraim and those of Israel who had not been
taken away as prisoners , and from all Judah and Benjamin and the people of Jerusalem .
And they gave it to the overseers of the work of the Lord's house, and the overseers gave it to the workmen working in the house, for building it up and making good what was damaged;
Even to the woodworkers and builders to get cut stone and wood for joining the structure together and for making boards for the houses which the kings of Judah had given up to destruction.
And the men did the work well ; and those who had authority over them were Jahath and Obadiah , Levites of the sons of Merari , and Zechariah and Meshullam , of the sons of the Kohathites , who were to be responsible for seeing that the work was
done ; and others of the Levites , who were expert with instruments of music ,
Had authority over the transport workers, giving directions to all who were doing any sort of work; and among the Levites there were scribes and overseers and door-keepers.
Now when they were taking out the money which had come into the Lord's house, Hilkiah the priest came across the book of the law of the Lord, which he had given by the mouth of Moses.
Then Hilkiah said to Shaphan the scribe, I have made discovery of the book of the law in the house of the Lord. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan.
And Shaphan took the book to the king; and he gave him an account of what had been done, saying, Your servants are doing all they have been given to do;
They have taken out all the money which was in the Lord's house and have given it to the overseers and to the workmen.
Then Shaphan the scribe said to the king, Hilkiah the priest has given me a book; and he made a start at reading some of it to the king.
And the king, hearing the words of the law, took his robe in his hands, violently parting it as a sign of his grief.
And he gave orders to Hilkiah and to Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Abdon, the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe and Asaiah, the king's servant, saying,
Go and get directions from the Lord for me and for those who are still in Israel and for Judah , about the words of this book which has come to light ; for great is the wrath of the Lord which has been let loose on us , because
our fathers have not kept the word of the Lord or done what is recorded in this book .
So Hilkiah , and those whom the king sent , went to Huldah the woman prophet , the wife of Shallum , the son of Tokhath , the son of Hasrah , the keeper of the robes ( now she was living in Jerusalem , in the second part of
the town ) ; and they had talk with her about this thing .
And she said to them, The Lord, the God of Israel, has said, Say to the man who sent you to me,
These are the words of the Lord: See, I will send evil on this place and on its people, even all the curses in the book which they have been reading before the king of Judah;
Because they have given me up, burning offerings to other gods and moving me to wrath by all the works of their hands; so my wrath is let loose on this place and will not be put out.
But to the king of Judah who sent you to get directions from the Lord, say, This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, has said: Because you have given ear to my words,
And your heart was soft , and you made yourself low before God , on hearing his words about this place and its people , and with weeping and signs of grief have made yourself low before me , I have given ear to you , says the Lord God
See , I will let you go to your fathers , and be put in your last resting-place in peace , and your eyes will not see all the evil which I will send on this place and on its people . So they took this news back to the
king .
Then the king sent and got together all the responsible men of Judah and of Jerusalem.
And the king went up to the house of the Lord , with all the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem , and the priests and the Levites and all the people , small and great ; and they were present at his reading of the book of
the law which had come to light in the house of the Lord .
Then the king , taking his place by the pillar , made an agreement before the Lord , to go in the way of the Lord , and to keep his orders and his decisions and his rules with all his heart and with all his soul , and to
keep the words of the agreement recorded in this book .
And he made all the people in Jerusalem and Benjamin give their word to keep it. And the people of Jerusalem kept the agreement of God, the God of their fathers.
Josiah took away all the disgusting things out of all the lands of the children of Israel , and made all who were in Israel servants of the Lord their God . And as long as he was living they were true to the Lord , the God of their
fathers .
And Josiah kept a Passover to the Lord in Jerusalem; on the fourteenth day of the first month they put the Passover lamb to death.
And he gave the priests their places, making them strong for the work of the house of God.
And he said to the Levites , the teachers of all Israel , who were holy to the Lord , See , the holy ark is in the house which Solomon , the son of David , king of Israel , made ; it will no longer have to be
transported on your backs : now be the servants of the Lord your God and his people Israel ,
And make yourselves ready in your divisions, by your families, as it is ordered in the writings of David, king of Israel, and of Solomon his son;
And take your positions in the holy place, grouped in the families of your brothers, the children of the people, and for every division let there be a part of a family of the Levites.
And put the Passover lamb to death, and make yourselves holy, and make it ready for your brothers, so that the orders given by the Lord through Moses may be done.
And Josiah gave lambs and goats from the flock as Passover offerings for all the people who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand oxen: these were from the king's private property.
And his captains freely gave an offering to the people , the priests , and the Levites . Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel , the rulers of the house of God , gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand , six hundred small cattle and three hundred
oxen .
And Conaniah and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand small cattle and five hundred oxen.
So everything was made ready and the priests took their places with the Levites in their divisions, as the king had said.
And they put the Passover lambs to death, the blood being drained out by the priests when it was given to them, and the Levites did the skinning.
And they took away the burned offerings, so that they might give them to be offered to the Lord for the divisions of the families of the people, as it is recorded in the book of Moses. And they did the same with the oxen.
And the Passover lamb was cooked over the fire, as it says in the law; and the holy offerings were cooked in pots and basins and vessels, and taken quickly to all the people.
And after that , they made ready for themselves and for the priests ; for the priests , the sons of Aaron , were offering the burned offerings and the fat till night ; so the Levites made ready what was needed for themselves and for the priests , the
sons of Aaron .
And the sons of Asaph , the makers of melody , were in their places , as ordered by David and Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun , the king ' s seer ; and the door-keepers were stationed at every door : there was no need for them to go
away from their places , for their brothers the Levites made ready for them .
So everything needed for the worship of the Lord was made ready that same day, for the keeping of the Passover and the offering of burned offerings on the altar of the Lord, as King Josiah had given orders.
And all the children of Israel who were present kept the Passover and the feast of unleavened bread at that time for seven days.
No Passover like it had been kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet ; and not one of the kings of Israel had ever kept a Passover like the one kept by Josiah and the priests and the Levites and all those of Judah and Israel who
were present , and the people of Jerusalem .
In the eighteenth year of the rule of Josiah this Passover was kept.
After all this, and after Josiah had put the house in order, Neco, king of Egypt, went up to make war at Carchemish by the river Euphrates; and Josiah went out against him.
But he sent representatives to him , saying , What have I to do with you , O king of Judah ? I have not come against you this day , but against those with whom I am at war ; and God has given me orders to go forward
quickly : keep out of God ' s way , for he is with me , or he will send destruction on you .
However, Josiah would not go back; but keeping to his purpose of fighting against him, and giving no attention to the words of Neco, which came from God, he went forward to the fight in the valley of Megiddo.
And the bowmen sent their arrows at King Josiah, and the king said to his servants, Take me away, for I am badly wounded.
So his servants took him out of the line of war-carriages , and put him in his second carriage and took him to Jerusalem , where he came to his end , and they put his body in the resting-place of his fathers . And in all Judah and Jerusalem
there was great weeping for Josiah .
And Jeremiah made a song of grief for Josiah ; and to this day Josiah is named by all the makers of melody , men and women , in their songs of grief ; they made it a rule in Israel ; and the songs are recorded among the songs
of grief .
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and the good he did, in keeping with what is recorded in the law of the Lord,
And all his acts, first and last, are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz, the son of Josiah, and made him king in Jerusalem in place of his father.
Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king; he was ruling in Jerusalem for three months.
Then the king of Egypt took the kingdom from him in Jerusalem, and put on the land a tax of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, changing his name to Jehoiakim. And Neco took his brother Jehoahaz away to Egypt.
Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king; he was ruling in Jerusalem for eleven years, and he did evil in the eyes of the Lord his God.
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up against him, and took him away in chains to Babylon.
And Nebuchadnezzar took away some of the vessels of the Lord's house, and put them in the house of his god in Babylon.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and the disgusting things he did, and all there is to be said against him, are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah; and Jehoiachin his son became king in his place.
Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king; he was ruling in Jerusalem for three months and ten days, and he did evil in the eyes of the Lord.
In the spring of the year King Nebuchadnezzar sent and took him away to Babylon, with the beautiful vessels of the house of the Lord, and made Zedekiah, his father's brother, king over Judah and Jerusalem.
Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king; he was ruling in Jerusalem for eleven years.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, and did not make himself low before Jeremiah the prophet who gave him the word of the Lord.
And he took up arms against King Nebuchadnezzar, though he had made him take an oath by God; but he made his neck stiff and his heart hard, turning away from the Lord, the God of Israel.
And more than this, all the great men of Judah and the priests and the people made their sin great, turning to all the disgusting ways of the nations; and they made unclean the house of the Lord which he had made holy in Jerusalem.
And the Lord, the God of their fathers, sent word to them by his servants, sending early and frequently, because he had pity on his people and on his living-place;
But they put shame on the servants of God, making sport of his words and laughing at his prophets, till the wrath of God was moved against his people, till there was no help.
So he sent against them the king of the Chaldaeans , who put their young men to death with the sword in the house of their holy place , and had no pity for any , young man or virgin , old man or white-haired : God gave them all
into his hands .
And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the stored wealth of the Lord's house and the wealth of the king and his chiefs, he took away to Babylon.
And the house of God was burned and the wall of Jerusalem broken down; all its great houses were burned with fire and all its beautiful vessels given up to destruction.
And all who had not come to death by the sword he took away prisoners to Babylon; and they became servants to him and to his sons till the kingdom of Persia came to power:
So that the words of the Lord, which he said by the mouth of Jeremiah, might come true, till the land had had pleasure in her Sabbaths; for as long as she was waste the land kept the Sabbath, till seventy years were complete.
Now in the first year of Cyrus , king of Persia , in order that the words which the Lord had said by the mouth of Jeremiah might come true , the spirit of Cyrus , king of Persia , was moved by the Lord , and he made a
public statement and had it given out through all his kingdom and put in writing , saying ,
Cyrus , king of Persia , has said , All the kingdoms of the earth have been given to me by the Lord , the God of heaven ; and he has made me responsible for building a house for him in Jerusalem , which is in Judah . Whoever
there is among you of all his people , may the Lord his God be with him and let him go up .
Then he made a brass altar, twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high.
And he made the great water-vessel of metal, round in form, measuring ten cubits across from edge to edge; it was five cubits high and thirty cubits round.
And under it was a design of flowers all round it, ten to a cubit, circling the water-vessel in two lines; they were made from liquid metal at the same time as the water-vessel.
It was supported on twelve oxen, three facing to the north, three to the west, three to the south, and three to the east, the water-vessel resting on top of them; their back parts were all turned to the middle of it.
It was as thick as a man's open hand, and the edge of it was curved like the edge of a cup, like a lily flower; it would take three thousand baths.
And he made ten washing-vessels, putting five on the right side and five on the left; such things as were used in making the burned offering were washed in them; but the great water-vessel was to be used by the priests for washing themselves.
And he made the ten gold supports for the lights, as directions had been given for them, and he put them in the Temple, five on the right side and five on the left.
He made ten tables, and put them in the Temple, five on the right side and five on the left. And he made a hundred gold basins.
Then he made the open space for the priests, and the great open space and its doors, plating the doors with brass.
He put the great water-vessel on the right side of the house to the east, facing south.
And Huram made all the pots and the spades and the basins. So he came to the end of all the work he did for King Solomon in the house of God:
The two pillars, and the two crowns on the tops of the pillars, and the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the tops of the pillars;
And the four hundred apples for the network, two lines of apples for the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the pillars.
And he made the ten bases and the ten washing-vessels which were on the bases;
The great water-vessel with the twelve oxen under it.
All the pots and the spades and the meat-hooks and their vessels, which Huram, who was as his father, made for King Solomon for the house of the Lord, were of polished brass.
The king made them of liquid metal in the lowland of Jordan, in the soft earth between Succoth and Zeredah.
So Solomon made all these vessels, a very great store of them, and the weight of the brass used was not measured.
And Solomon made all the vessels used in the house of God, the gold altar and the tables on which the holy bread was placed,
And the supports for the lights with their lights, to be burning in the regular way in front of the inmost room, of the best gold;
The flowers and the vessels for the lights and the instruments used for them, were all of gold; it was the best gold.
The scissors and the basins and the spoons and the fire-trays, of the best gold; and the inner doors of the house, opening into the most holy place, and the doors of the Temple, were all of gold.
So all the work which Solomon did for the house of the Lord was complete . And Solomon took the holy things which David his father had given , the silver and the gold and all the vessels , and put them in the store-houses of the house of God
Then Solomon sent for all the responsible men of Israel , all the chiefs of the tribes and the heads of families of the children of Israel , to come to Jerusalem and take the ark of the Lord ' s agreement up out of the town of David ,
which is Zion .
And all the men of Israel came together to the king at the feast in the seventh month.
All the responsible men of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark.
They took up the ark and the Tent of meeting and all the holy vessels which were in the Tent; all these the priests, the Levites, took up.
And King Solomon and all the men of Israel who had come together there with him, were before the ark, making offerings of sheep and oxen more than might be numbered.
And the priests took the ark of the Lord's agreement and put it in its place, in the inner room of the house, in the most holy place, under the wings of the winged ones.
For their wings were outstretched over the place where the ark was, covering the ark and its rods.
The rods were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place before the inmost room; but they were not seen from outside; and there they are to this day.
Nothing was in the ark but the two flat stones which Moses put there at Horeb, where the Lord made an agreement with the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt.
Now when the priests had come out of the holy place, (for all the priests who were present had made themselves holy, not keeping to their divisions;
And the Levites who made the music , all of them , Asaph , Heman , Jeduthun , and their sons and brothers , robed in fair linen , were in their places with their brass and corded instruments at the east side of the altar , and with them
a hundred and twenty priests blowing horns ; )
And when the players on horns , and those who made melody in song , with one voice were sounding the praise and glory of the Lord ; with loud voices and with wind instruments , and brass and corded instruments of music , praising the Lord and saying ,
He is good ; his mercy is unchanging for ever : then the house was full of the cloud of the glory of the Lord ,
So that the priests were not able to keep their places to do their work because of the cloud; for the house of God was full of the glory of the Lord.
Then Solomon said, O Lord, to the sun you have given the heaven for a living-place, but your living-place was not seen by men,
So I have made for you a living-place, a house in which you may be for ever present.
Then, turning his face about, the king gave a blessing to all the men of Israel; and they were all on their feet together.
And he said, Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who himself gave his word to my father David, and with his strong hand has made his word come true, saying,
From the day when I took my people out of the land of Egypt , no town in all the tribes of Israel has been marked out by me for the building of a house for the resting-place of my name ; and I took no man to be a
ruler over my people Israel ;
But now I have made selection of Jerusalem, that my name might be there, and of David, to be over my people Israel.
Now it was in the heart of my father David to put up a house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.
But the Lord said to David my father, You did well to have in your heart the desire to make a house for my name:
But you yourself will not be the builder of the house; but your son, the offspring of your body, he it is who will put up a house for my name.
And the Lord has kept his word ; for I have taken my father David ' s place on the seat of the kingdom of Israel , as the Lord gave his word ; and I have made the house for the name of the Lord the God of Israel
And there I have put the ark, in which is the agreement of the Lord, which he made with the people of Israel.
Then he took his place in front of the altar of the Lord, all the men of Israel being present,
( For Solomon had made a brass stage , five cubits long , five cubits wide and three cubits high , and had put it in the middle of the open space ; on this he took his place and went down on his knees before all the meeting of
Israel , stretching out his hands to heaven . )
And he said, O Lord, the God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven or on earth; keeping faith and mercy unchanging for your servants, while they go in your ways with all their hearts;
For you have kept the word which you gave to your servant David, my father; with your mouth you said it and with your hand you have made it come true this day.
So now , O Lord , the God of Israel , let your word to your servant David , my father , come true , when you said , You will never be without a man to take his place before me on the seat of the kingdom of Israel
; if only your children give attention to their ways , walking in my law , as you have done before me .
So now, O Lord, the God of Israel, make your word come true which you said to your servant David.
But is it truly possible that God may be housed with men on earth? see, heaven and the heaven of heavens are not wide enough to be your resting-place: how much less this house which I have made:
Still, let your heart be turned to the prayer of your servant and to his prayer for grace, O Lord my God, and give ear to the cry and the prayer which your servant makes before you;
That your eyes may be open to this house day and night, to this place of which you have said that you would put your name there; to give ear to the prayer which your servant may make, turning to this place.
And give ear to the prayers of your servant and of your people Israel, when they make their prayers, turning to this place; give ear from heaven your living-place; and hearing have mercy.
If a man does wrong to his neighbour and has to take an oath, and comes before your altar to take his oath in this house:
Then let your ear be open in heaven, and be the judge of your servants, giving punishment to the wrongdoer, so that his sin may come on his head; and, by your decision, keeping from evil him who has done no wrong.
And if your people Israel are overcome in war, because of their sin against you; if they are turned to you again, honouring your name, making prayers and requesting your grace in this house:
Then give ear from heaven, and let the sin of your people Israel have forgiveness, and take them back again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers.
When heaven is shut up and there is no rain, because of their sin against you: if they make prayers with their faces turned to this place, honouring your name and turning away from their sin when you send trouble on them:
Then give ear from heaven , so that the sin of your servants and the sin of your people Israel may have forgiveness , when you make clear to them the good way in which they are to go ; and send rain on your land which you have given
to your people for their heritage .
If there is no food in the land, if there is disease, if the fruits of the earth are damaged by heat or water, locust or worm; if their towns are shut in by their attackers: whatever trouble or whatever disease there may be:
Whatever prayer or request for your grace is made by any man, or by all your people Israel, whatever his trouble may be, whose hands are stretched out to this house:
Then give ear from heaven your living-place , answering with forgiveness , and give to every man , whose secret heart is open to you , the reward of all his ways ; ( for you , and you only , have knowledge of the hearts of the children of
men ; )
So that they may give you worship, walking in your ways, as long as they are living in the land which you gave to our fathers.
And as for the man from a strange land , who is not of your people Israel but comes from a far country because of the glory of your name and your strong hand and your outstretched arm ; when he comes to make his prayer , turning to this
house :
Then give ear from heaven your living-place , and give him his desire , whatever it may be ; so that all the peoples of the earth may have knowledge of your name , worshipping you as do your people Israel , and may see that this house which I
have made is truly named by your name .
If your people go out to war against their attackers, by whatever way you may send them, if they make their prayers to you turning their faces to this town of yours and to this house which I have put up for your name:
Then give ear from heaven to their prayer and their cry for grace, and see right done to them.
If they do wrong against you , ( for no man is without sin , ) and you are angry with them , and give them up into the power of those who are fighting against them , so that they take them away prisoners to a land far off
or near ;
And if they take thought, in the land where they are prisoners, turning again to you, crying out in prayer to you in that land, and saying, We are sinners, we have done wrong, we have done evil;
If with all their heart and soul they are turned again to you , in the land where they are prisoners , the land where they have been taken , and make their prayers , turning their eyes to their land which you gave to their fathers , and to
the town which you took for yourself , and the house which I have made for your name :
Then give ear from heaven your living-place to their prayer and their cry, and see right done to them, answering with forgiveness your people who have done wrong against you.
Now, O my God, may your eyes be open and your ears awake to the prayers made in this place.
Up! now, O Lord God, come back to your resting-place, you and the ark of your strength: let your priests, O Lord God, be clothed with salvation, and let your saints be glad in what is good.
O Lord God, let him whom you have taken for yourself never be given up by you: keep in mind your mercies to David your servant.
Now when Solomon's prayers were ended, fire came down from heaven, burning up all the offerings; and the house was full of the glory of the Lord.
And the priests were not able to go into the house of the Lord, for the Lord's house was full of the glory of the Lord.
And all the children of Israel were looking on when the fire came down , and the glory of the Lord was on the house ; and they went down on their knees , with their faces to the earth , worshipping and praising the Lord , and saying ,
He is good ; for his mercy is unchanging for ever .
Then the king and all the people made offerings before the Lord.
King Solomon made an offering of twenty-two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people kept the feast of the opening of the house of God.
And the priests were in their places , and the Levites with their instruments of music for the Lord ' s song , which David the king had made for the praise of the Lord whose mercy is unchanging for ever , when David gave praise by their hand ;
and the priests were sounding horns before them ; and all Israel were on their feet .
Then Solomon made holy the middle of the open square in front of the house of the Lord , offering the burned offerings there , and the fat of the peace-offerings ; for there was not room on the brass altar which Solomon had made for all the burned offerings
and the meal offerings and the fat .
So Solomon kept the feast at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great meeting, for the people had come together from the way into Hamath and from as far as the river of Egypt.
And on the eighth day they had a holy meeting; the offerings for making the altar holy went on for seven days, and the feast for seven days.
And on the twenty-third day of the seventh month, he sent the people away to their tents, full of joy and glad in their hearts, because of all the good which the Lord had done to David and to Solomon and to Israel his people.
So Solomon came to the end of building the house of the Lord and the king's house; and everything which it was in his mind to make in the house of the Lord and for himself had been well done.
Now the Lord came to Solomon in a vision by night, and said to him, I have given ear to your prayer, and have taken this place for myself as a house where offerings are to be made.
If, at my word, heaven is shut up, so that there is no rain, or if I send locusts on the land for its destruction, or if I send disease on my people;
If my people , on whom my name is named , make themselves low and come to me in prayer , searching for me and turning from their evil ways ; then I will give ear from heaven , overlooking their sin , and will give life again to their
land .
Now my eyes will be open and my ears awake to the prayers made in this place.
For I have taken this house for myself and made it holy, so that my name may be there for ever; and my eyes and my heart will be there at all times.
And as for you, if you will go on your way before me as David your father did, doing whatever I have given you orders to do and keeping my laws and my decisions:
Then I will make strong the seat of your kingdom, as I gave my word to David your father, saying, You will never be without a man to be ruler in Israel.
But if you are turned away from me, and do not keep my orders and my laws which I have put before you, but go and make yourselves servants to other gods, giving them worship:
Then I will have this people uprooted out of my land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have made holy for my name , I will put away from before my eyes , and make it an example and a word of shame among
all peoples .
And this house will become a mass of broken walls, and everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder, and will say, Why has the Lord done so to this land and to this house?
And their answer will be , Because they were turned away from the Lord , the God of their fathers , who took them out of the land of Egypt , and took for themselves other gods and gave them worship and became their servants : that is why he
has sent all this evil on them .
Now at the end of twenty years, in which time Solomon had put up the house of the Lord and a house for himself,
He took in hand the building up of the towns which Huram had given him, causing the children of Israel to make living-places for themselves there.
And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and overcame it.
And he put up the buildings of Tadmor in the waste land, and of all the store-towns in Hamath;
And of Beth-horon the higher and the lower, walled towns with walls and doorways and locks;
And of Baalath, and all the store-towns which Solomon had, and the towns where he kept his war-carriages and his horse men, and everything which it was his pleasure to put up in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land under his rule.
As for all the rest of the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel:
Their men who were still living in the land, and whom the children of Israel had not put an end to, these Solomon put to forced work, as is done to this day;
But Solomon did not make use of the children of Israel as servants for his work; they were men of war, his chiefs and his captains, and captains of his war-carriages and his horsemen.
Now these were the chief men in authority whom King Solomon had: two hundred and fifty of them, in authority over the people.
Then Solomon made Pharaoh ' s daughter come up from the town of David to the house which he had made for her ; for he said , I will not have my wife living in the house of David , king of Israel , because those places where the
ark of the Lord has come are holy .
Then Solomon made burned offerings to the Lord on the altar of the Lord which he had put up in front of the covered way,
Offering every day what had been ordered by Moses, on the Sabbaths and at the new moon and at the regular feasts three times a year, that is at the feast of unleavened bread, the feast of weeks, and the feast of tents.
And he gave the divisions of the priests their places for their work , as ordered by his father David , and to the Levites he gave their work of praise and waiting on the priests , to do what was needed day by day ; and he gave the
door-keepers their places in turn at every door ; for so David , the man of God , had given orders .
All the orders given by the king to the priests and Levites, in connection with any business or stores, were done with care.
And all the work of Solomon was complete, from the day when he put the base of the Lord's house in position, till Solomon had come to the end of building the Lord's house.
Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth by the sea in the land of Edom.
And Huram sent him, by his servants, ships and experienced seamen, who went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir and came back with four hundred and fifty talents of gold, which they took to King Solomon.
Now the queen of Sheba , hearing great things of Solomon , came to Jerusalem to put his wisdom to the test with hard questions ; and with her came a very great train , and camels weighted down with spices , and great stores of gold and jewels :
and when she came to Solomon she had talk with him of everything in her mind .
And Solomon gave her answers to all her questions; there was no secret which he did not make clear to her.
And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he had made,
And the food at his table , and all his servants seated there , and those who were waiting on him in their places , and their robes , and his wine-servants and their robes , and the burned offerings which he made in the house of the Lord ,
there was no more spirit in her .
And she said to the king, The account which was given to me in my country of your acts and your wisdom was true.
But I had no faith in what was said about you, till I came and saw for myself; and truly, word was not given me of half your great wisdom; you are much greater than they said.
Happy are your wives and happy these your servants whose place is ever before you, hearing your words of wisdom.
Praise be to the Lord your God whose pleasure it was to put you on the seat of his kingdom to be king for the Lord your God : because , in his love for Israel , it was the purpose of your God to make them strong for ever
, he made you king over them , to be their judge in righteousness .
And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a great store of spices and jewels: never had such spices been seen as the queen of Sheba gave to Solomon.
And the servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon, in addition to gold from Ophir, came back with sandal-wood and jewels.
And with the sandal-wood the king made steps for the house of the Lord and for the king's house, and instruments of music for the makers of melody; never before had such been seen in the land of Judah.
And King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she made request for, in addition to what she had taken to the king. So she went back to her country with her servants.
Now the weight of gold which came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents;
And in addition to what he got from traders of different sorts, all the kings of Arabia and the rulers of the country gave gold and silver to Solomon.
And King Solomon made two hundred body-covers of hammered gold, every one having six hundred shekels of gold in it.
And he made three hundred smaller body-covers of hammered gold, using three hundred shekels of gold for every cover, and the king put them in the house of the Woods of Lebanon.
Then the king made a great ivory seat, plated with the best gold.
There were six steps up to it, and a foot-rest of gold fixed to it, and arms on the two sides of the seat, with two lions at the side of the arms.
And twelve lions were placed on one side and on the other side on the six steps: there was nothing like it in any kingdom.
All King Solomon's drinking-vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the Woods of Lebanon were of the best gold: no one gave a thought to silver in the days of Solomon.
For the king had Tarshish-ships sailing with the servants of Huram: once every three years the Tarshish-ships came back with gold and silver, ivory and monkeys and peacocks.
And King Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in wealth and in wisdom.
And all the kings of the earth came to see Solomon and to give ear to his wisdom, which God had put into his heart.
And everyone took with him an offering, vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and robes, and coats of metal, and spices, and horses and beasts for transport, regularly year by year.
Solomon had four thousand buildings for his horses and his war-carriages, and twelve thousand horsemen whom he kept, some in the carriage-towns and some with the king in Jerusalem.
And he was ruler over all the kings from the River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the limit of Egypt.
The king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem and cedars like the sycamore-trees of the lowlands in number.
They got horses for Solomon from Egypt and from every land.
Now the rest of the acts of Solomon , first and last , are they not recorded in the history of Nathan the prophet , and in the words of Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh , and in the visions of Iddo the seer about Jeroboam , the son of
Nebat ?
Solomon was king over Israel in Jerusalem for forty years.
And Solomon went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth in the town of David his father; and Rehoboam his son became king in his place.
After the death of Ahab, Moab made itself free from the authority of Israel.
Now Ahaziah had a fall from the window of his room in Samaria , and was ill . And he sent men , and said to them , Put a question to Baal-zebub , the god of Ekron , about the outcome of my disease , to see if I
will get well or not .
But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite , Go now , and , meeting the men sent by the king of Samaria , say to them , Is it because there is no God in Israel , that you are going to get directions from Baal-zebub
, the god of Ekron ?
Give ear then to the words of the Lord: You will never again get down from the bed on to which you have gone up, but death will certainly come to you. Then Elijah went away.
And the men he had sent came back to the king; and he said to them, Why have you come back?
And they said to him , On our way we had a meeting with a man who said , Go back to the king who sent you and say to him , The Lord says , Is it because there is no God in Israel that you send to put
a question to Baal-zebub , the god of Ekron ? For this reason , you will not come down from the bed on to which you have gone up , but death will certainly come to you .
And he said to them, What sort of a man was it who came and said these words to you?
And they said in answer, He was a man clothed in a coat of hair, with a leather band about his body. Then he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty men; and he went up to him where he was seated on the top of a hill, and said to him, O man of God, the king has said, Come down.
And Elijah in answer said to the captain of fifty , If I am a man of God , may fire come down from heaven on you and on your fifty men , and put an end to you . Then fire came down from heaven and put an end
to him and his fifty men .
Then the king sent another captain of fifty with his fifty men; and he said to Elijah, O man of God, the king says, Come down quickly.
And Elijah in answer said , If I am a man of God , may fire come down from heaven on you and on your fifty men , and put an end to you . And the fire of God came down from heaven , and put an end to
him and his fifty men .
Then he sent a third captain of fifty with his fifty men ; and the third captain of fifty went up , and falling on his knees before Elijah , requesting mercy of him , said , O man of God , let my life and the life of these
your fifty servants be of value to you .
For fire came down from heaven and put an end to the first two captains of fifty and their fifties; but now let my life be of value in your eyes.
Then the angel of the Lord said to Elijah, Go down with him; have no fear of him. So he got up and went down with him to the king.
And he said to him , This is the word of the Lord : Because you sent men to put a question to Baal-zebub , the god of Ekron , for this reason you will never again get down from the bed on to which you have gone up ,
but death will certainly come to you .
So death came to him, as the Lord had said by the mouth of Elijah. And Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of the rule of Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah; because he had no son.
Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?
Now there were in Samaria seventy of Ahab's sons. And Jehu sent letters to Samaria, to the rulers of the town, and to the responsible men, and to those who had the care of the sons of Ahab, saying,
Straight away, when you get this letter, seeing that your master's sons are with you, and that you have carriages and horses and a walled town and arms;
Take the best and most upright of your master's sons, and make him king in his father's place, and put up a fight for your master's family.
But they were full of fear, and said, The two kings have gone down before him: how may we keep our place?
So the controller of the king ' s house , with the ruler of the town , and the responsible men , and those who had the care of Ahab ' s sons , sent to Jehu , saying , We are your servants and will do all your orders
; we will not make any man king ; do whatever seems best to you .
Then he sent them a second letter , saying , If you are on my side , and if you will do my orders , come to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow , with the heads of your master ' s sons . Now the king ' s
seventy sons were with the great men of the town , who had the care of them .
And when the letter came to them, they took the king's sons and put them to death, all the seventy, and put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel.
And a man came and said to him, They have come with the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Put them down in two masses at the doorway of the town till the morning.
And in the morning he went out and , stopping , said to all the people there , You are upright men : it is true that I made designs against my master , and put him to death ; but who is responsible for the death of all these
You may be certain that nothing which the Lord has said about the family of Ahab will be without effect; for the Lord has done what he said by his servant Elijah.
So Jehu put to death all the rest of the seed of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his relations and his near friends and his priests, till there were no more of them.
Then he got up and came to Samaria. And he was at the meeting-place of the keepers of sheep, by the way,
When he came across the brothers of Ahaziah , king of Judah , and said , Who are you ? And they said , We are the brothers of Ahaziah , king of Judah ; we are going down to see the children of the king and of the queen
And he said, Take them living. So they took them living, and put them to death in the water-hole of Beth-eked; of the forty-two men he put every one to death;
And when he had gone away from there , he came across Jehonadab , the son of Rechab : and he said good-day to him , and said to him , Is your heart true to mine , as mine is to yours ? And Jehonadab in answer said ,
It is ; and Jehu said , If it is , give me your hand . And he gave him his hand , and he made him come up into his carriage .
And he said, Come with me and see how I am on fire for the Lord's cause. So he made him go with him in his carriage.
And when he came to Samaria, he put to death all those of Ahab's family who were still in Samaria, till there were no more of them, as the Lord had said to Elijah.
Then Jehu got all the people together and said to them, Ahab was Baal's servant in a small way, but Jehu will be his servant on a great scale.
Now send for all the prophets of Baal and all his servants and all his priests , to come to me ; let no one keep away : for I have a great offering to make to Baal ; anyone who is not present , will be put to death
. This Jehu did with deceit , his purpose being the destruction of the servants of Baal .
And Jehu said, Let there be a special holy meeting for the worship of Baal. So a public statement was made.
And Jehu sent out through all Israel; and all the servants of Baal came, not one kept away. And they came into the house of Baal, so that it was full from end to end.
And Jehu said to him who kept the robes, Get out robes for all the servants of Baal. So he got out robes for them.
And Jehu , with Jehonadab , the son of Rechab , went into the house of Baal ; and he said to the servants of Baal , Make a search with care , to see that no servant of the Lord is with you , but only servants of Baal
Then they went in to make offerings and burned offerings . Now Jehu had put eighty men outside , and said to them , If any man whom I give into your hands gets away , the life of him who lets him go will be the price of his
life .
Then when the burned offering was ended , straight away Jehu said to the armed men and the captains , Go in and put them to death ; let not one come out . So they put them to the sword ; and , pulling the images to the earth
, they went into the holy place of the house of Baal .
And they took out the image of Asherah from the house of Baal, and had it burned.
The altar of Baal was pulled down and the house of Baal was broken up and made an unclean place, as it is to this day.
So Jehu put an end to the worship of Baal in Israel.
But Jehu did not keep himself from all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and the evil he made Israel do; the gold oxen were still in Beth-el and in Dan.
And the Lord said to Jehu, Because you have done well in doing what is right in my eyes and effecting all my purpose for the family of Ahab, your sons will be kings of Israel to the fourth generation.
But Jehu did not take care to keep the law of the Lord with all his heart: he did not keep himself from the sin which Jeroboam did and made Israel do.
In those days the Lord was angry first with Israel; and Hazael made attacks on all the land of Israel,
East of Jordan, in all the land of Gilead, the Gadites and the Reubenites and the Manassites, from Aroer by the valley of the Arnon, all Gilead and Bashan.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all he did, and his great power, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?
And Jehu went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son became king in his place.
And the time of Jehu's rule over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
Now when Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, saw that her son was dead, she had all the rest of the seed of the kingdom put to death.
But Jehosheba , the daughter of King Joram , sister of Ahaziah , secretly took Joash , the son of Ahaziah , with the woman who took care of him , away from among the king ' s sons who were put to death , and put him in the
bedroom ; and they kept him safe from Athaliah , so that he was not put to death .
And for six years she kept him safe in the house of the Lord, while Athaliah was ruling over the land.
Then in the seventh year , Jehoiada sent for the captains of hundreds of the Carians , and the armed men , and taking them into the house of the Lord , made an agreement with them , and made them take an oath in the house of the Lord
, and let them see the king ' s son .
And he gave them orders, saying, This is what you are to do: the third part of you, who come in on the Sabbath and keep the watch of the king's house,
...
And the two divisions of you, who go out on the Sabbath and keep the watch of the house of the Lord,
Will make a circle round the king, every man being armed; and whoever comes inside your lines is to be put to death; keep with the king, when he goes out and when he comes in.
And the captains of hundreds did as Jehoiada the priest gave them orders; every one took with him his men, those who came in and those who went out on the Sabbath, and they came in to Jehoiada the priest.
And the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and body-covers which had been King David's, and which were kept in the house of the Lord.
Then the armed men took up their positions, every man with his instruments of war in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left, round about the altar and the house.
Then he made the king ' s son come out , and put the crown on him and the arm-bands , and made him king , and put the holy oil on him ; and they all , making sounds of joy with their hands , said , Long life
to the king .
Now Athaliah, hearing the noise made by the people, came to the people in the house of the Lord;
And looking , she saw the king in his regular place by the pillar , and the captains and the horns near him ; and all the people of the land giving signs of joy and sounding the horns . Then Athaliah , violently parting her robes , gave a
cry , saying , Broken faith , broken faith !
Then Jehoiada the priest gave orders to those who were placed in authority over the army , saying , Take her outside the lines , and let anyone who goes after her be put to death with the sword , for he said , Let her not be put to
death in the house of the Lord .
So they put their hands on her, and she went to the king's house by the doorway of the horses, and there she was put to death.
And Jehoiada made an agreement between the Lord and the king and the people, that they would be the Lord's people; and in the same way between the king and the people.
Then all the people of the land went to the house of Baal and had it pulled down : its altars and images were all broken to bits , and Mattan , the priest of Baal , they put to death before the altars . And the priest put overseers
over the Lord ' s house .
Then he took the captains of hundreds , and the Carians , and the armed men , and all the people of the land ; and they came down with the king from the house of the Lord , through the doorway of the armed men , to the king
' s house . And he took his place on the seat of the kings .
So all the people of the land were glad, and the town was quiet; and they had put Athaliah to death with the sword at the king's house.
And Jehoash was seven years old when he became king.
In the seventh year of Jehu's rule, Jehoash became king; and he was ruling for forty years in Jerusalem; his mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.
Jehoash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord all his days, because he was guided by the teaching of Jehoiada the priest.
But the high places were not taken away; the people went on making offerings and burning them in the high places.
And Jehoash said to the priests , All the money of the holy things , which comes into the house of the Lord , ( the amount fixed for every man ' s payment , ) and all the money given by any man freely from the impulse of his
heart ,
Let the priests take, every man from his friends and neighbours, to make good what is damaged in the house, wherever it is to be seen.
But in the twenty-third year of King Jehoash, the priests had not made good the damaged parts of the house.
Then King Jehoash sent for Jehoiada the priest , and the other priests , and said to them , Why have you not made good what is damaged in the house ? now take no more money from your neighbours , but give it for the building up of the
house .
So the priests made an agreement to take no more money from the people, and not to make good what was damaged in the house.
But Jehoiada the priest took a chest , and making a hole in the cover of it , put it by the altar , on the right side when one comes into the house of the Lord ; and the priests who kept the door put in it regularly all
the money which was taken into the house of the Lord .
And when they saw that there was much money in the chest, the king's scribe and the high priest came and put it in bags, noting the amount of all the money there was in the house of the Lord.
And the money which was measured out they gave regularly to those who were responsible for overseeing the work, and these gave it in payment to the woodworkers and the builders who were working on the house of the Lord,
And to the wall-builders and the stone-cutters, and to get wood and cut stone for building up the broken parts of the house of the Lord, and for everything needed to put the house in good order.
But the money was not used for making silver cups or scissors or basins or wind-instruments or any vessels of gold or silver for the house of the Lord;
But it was all given to the workmen who were building up the house.
And they did not get any statement of accounts from the men to whom the money was given for the workmen, for they made use of it with good faith.
The money of the offerings for error and the sin-offerings was not taken into the house of the Lord; it was the priests'.
Then Hazael, king of Aram, went up against Gath and took it; and his purpose was to go up to Jerusalem.
Then Jehoash , king of Judah , took all the holy things which Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah his fathers , the kings of Judah , had given to the Lord , together with the things he himself had given , and all the gold in the Temple store and
in the king ' s house , and sent it to Hazael , king of Aram ; and he went away from Jerusalem .
Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?
And his servants made a secret design and put Joash to death at the house of Millo on the way down to Silla.
And Jozacar , the son of Shimeath , and Jehozabad , the son of Shomer , his servants , came to him and put him to death ; and they put him into the earth with his fathers in the town of David ; and Amaziah his son became king
in his place .
In the twenty-third year of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, became king over Israel in Samaria, ruling for seventeen years.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, copying the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, which he did and made Israel do; he did not keep himself from them.
So the wrath of the Lord was burning against Israel, and he gave them up into the power of Hazael, king of Aram, and into the power of Ben-hadad, the son of Hazael, again and again.
Then Jehoahaz made prayer to the Lord, and the Lord gave ear to him, for he saw how cruelly Israel was crushed by the king of Aram.
(And the Lord gave Israel a saviour, so that they became free from the hands of the Aramaeans; and the children of Israel were living in their tents as in the past.
But still they did not give up the sin of Jeroboam, which he made Israel do, but went on with it; and there was an image of Asherah in Samaria.)
For out of all his army, Jehoahaz had only fifty horsemen and ten carriages and ten thousand footmen; the king of Aram had given them up to destruction, crushing them like dust.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all he did, and his great power, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?
And Jehoahaz went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth in Samaria; and Joash his son became king in his place.
In the thirty-seventh year of the rule of Joash, king of Judah, Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, became king over Israel in Samaria, ruling for sixteen years.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, not turning away from the sin of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, which he did and made Israel do, but he went on with it.
Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all he did, and the force with which he went to war against Amaziah, king of Judah, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?
And Joash went to rest with his fathers and Jeroboam took his place as king; and Joash was put into the earth in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
Now Elisha became ill with the disease which was the cause of his death: and Joash, king of Israel, came down to him, and weeping over him said, My father, my father, the war-carriages of Israel and its horsemen!
Then Elisha said to him, Take bow and arrows: and he took bow and arrows.
And he said to the king of Israel, Put your hand on the bow: and he put his hand on it; and Elisha put his hands on the king's hands.
Then he said ; Let the window be open to the east : and he got it open . Then Elisha said , Let the arrow go ; and he let it go . And he said , The Lord ' s arrow of salvation , of salvation over Aram
; for you will overcome the Aramaeans in Aphek and put an end to them .
And he said, Take the arrows: and he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, Send them down into the earth; and he did so three times and no more.
Then the man of God was angry with him and said, If you had done it five or six times, then you would have overcome Aram completely; but now you will only overcome them three times.
And death came to Elisha and they put his body into the earth. Now in the spring of the year, armed bands of Moabites frequently came, overrunning the land.
And while they were putting a dead man into the earth , they saw a band coming ; and they put the man quickly into the place where Elisha ' s body was ; and the dead man , on touching Elisha ' s bones , came to life again
, and got up on his feet .
And Israel was crushed under the power of Hazael, king of Aram, all the days of Jehoahaz.
But the Lord was kind to them and had pity on them, caring for them, because of his agreement with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; he would not put them to destruction or send them away from before his face till now.
Then Hazael, king of Aram, came to his end; and Ben-hadad his son became king in his place.
And Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, took again from Ben-hadad, the son of Hazael, the towns which he had taken from Jehoahaz his father in war. Three times Jehoash overcame him and got back the towns of Israel.
In the second year of Joash, son of Joahaz, king of Israel, Amaziah, the son of Joash, became king of Judah.
He was twenty-five years old when he became king; and he was ruling in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years; his mother's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.
He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, though not like David his father; he did as Joash his father had done.
But still the high places were not taken away; the people went on making offerings and burning them in the high places.
Now when he became strong in the kingdom, straight away he put to death those servants who had taken the life of the king his father;
But he did not put their children to death ; for the orders of the Lord recorded in the book of the law of Moses say , The fathers are not to be put to death for the children , or the children for their fathers ; but a man
is to be put to death for the sin which he himself has done .
He put to the sword twelve thousand men of Edom in the Valley of Salt, and took Sela in war, naming it Joktheel, as it is to this day.
Then Amaziah sent representatives to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us have a meeting face to face.
And Jehoash , king of Israel , sent to Amaziah , king of Judah , saying , The thorn-tree in Lebanon sent to the cedar in Lebanon , saying , Give your daughter to my son for a wife : and a beast from the woodland in Lebanon went by
, crushing the thorn under his feet .
It is true that you have overcome Edom and your heart is uplifted; let that glory be enough for you, and keep in your country; why do you make causes of trouble, putting yourself, and Judah with you, in danger of downfall?
But Amaziah gave no attention. So Jehoash, king of Israel, went up, and he and Amaziah, king of Judah, came face to face at Beth-shemesh, which is in Judah.
And Judah was overcome before Israel, so that they went in flight, every man to his tent.
And Jehoash , king of Israel , made Amaziah , king of Judah , the son of Jehoash , son of Ahaziah , prisoner at Beth-shemesh , and came to Jerusalem , and had the wall of Jerusalem pulled down from the doorway of Ephraim to the door in the
angle , four hundred cubits .
And he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels which were in the house of the Lord and in the store-house of the king, together with those whose lives would be the price of broken faith, and went back to Samaria.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash, and his power, and how he went to war with Amaziah, king of Judah, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?
And Jehoash went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son became king in his place.
Amaziah, the son of Joash, king of Judah, went on living for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash, son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.
And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah?
Now they made a secret design against him in Jerusalem; and he went in flight to Lachish, but they sent after him to Lachish and put him to death there.
And they took his body on horseback and put it into the earth with his fathers in Jerusalem, the town of David.
Then all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
He was the builder of Elath, which he got back for Judah after the death of the king.
In the fifteenth year of the rule of Amaziah, son of Joash, king of Judah, Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, became king in Samaria, ruling for forty-one years.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, not turning away from the sin which Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, did and made Israel do.
He got back the old limits of Israel from the way into Hamath to the sea of the Arabah, as the Lord had said by his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet of Gath-hepher.
For the Lord saw how bitter was the trouble of Israel, and that everyone was cut off, he who was shut up and he who went free, and that Israel had no helper.
And the Lord had not said that the name of Israel was to be taken away from the earth; but he gave them a saviour in Jeroboam, the son of Joash.
Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam , and all he did , and his power , and how he went to war with Damascus , causing the wrath of the Lord to be turned away from Israel , are they not recorded in the book of the history
of the kings of Israel ?
And Jeroboam went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth with the kings of Israel; and Zechariah his son became king in his place.
In the twenty-seventh year of the rule of Jeroboam, king of Israel, Azariah, son of Amaziah, became king of Judah.
He was sixteen years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for fifty-two years; his mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
And he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Amaziah had done.
But he did not take away the high places, and the people still went on making offerings and burning them in the high places.
And the Lord sent disease on the king and he became a leper, and to the day of his death he was living separately in his private house. And Jotham his son was over his house, judging the people of the land.
Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah?
And Azariah went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth with his fathers in the town of David; and Jotham his son became king in his place.
In the thirty-eighth year of Azaliah, king of Judah, Zechariah, son of Jeroboam, was king over Israel for six months.
And he did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as his father had done, not turning away from the sin which Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, did and made Israel do.
And Shallum, the son of Jabesh, made a secret design against him, and, attacking him in Ibleam, put him to death and became king in his place.
Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
This was what the Lord had said to Jehu, Your sons to the fourth generation will be kings of Israel. And so it came about.
Shallum, the son of Jabesh, became king in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah, king of Judah; and he was ruling in Samaria for the space of one month.
Then Menahem, the son of Gadi, went up from Tirzah and came to Samaria, and attacking Shallum, son of Jabesh, in Samaria, put him to death and made himself king in his place.
Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and the secret design which he made, are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
Then Menahem sent destruction on Tappuah and all the people in it, and its limits, from Tirzah, because they would not let him come in; and he had all the women who were with child cut open.
In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah, king of Judah, Menahem, the son of Gadi, became king over Israel, and was ruling in Samaria for ten years.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord; he did not keep himself from the sin which Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, did and made Israel do.
In his day, Pul, the king of Assyria, came up against the land; and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver so that he might let him keep the kingdom.
And Menahem got the money from Israel, from all the men of wealth, fifty silver shekels from every man, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria went back without stopping in the land.
Now the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?
And Menahem went to rest with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son became king in his place.
In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah, the son of Menahem, became king over Israel in Samaria, ruling for two years.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, not turning from the sin which Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, did and made Israel do.
And Pekah , the son of Remaliah , his captain , made a secret design against him , attacking him in the king ' s great house in Samaria ; and with him were fifty men of Gilead ; and he put him to death and became king in his
place .
Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all he did, are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
In the fifty-second year of Azariah, king of Judah, Pekah, the son of Remaliah, became king over Israel in Samaria, ruling for twenty years.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, not turning from the sin which Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, did and made Israel do.
In the days of Pekah, king of Israel, Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria, came and took Ijon and Abel-beth-maacah and Janoah and Kedesh and Hazor and Gilead and Galilee and all the land of Naphtali; and he took the people away to Assyria.
And Hoshea, the son of Elah, made a secret design against Pekah, the son of Remaliah, and, attacking him, put him to death and became king in his place, in the twentieth year of Jotham, the son of Uzziah.
Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all he did, are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
In the second year of Pekah, the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, Jotham, the son of Uzziah, became king of Judah.
He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he was ruling for sixteen years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.
And he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Uzziah had done.
But he did not take away the high places, and the people still went on making offerings and burning them in the high places. He was the builder of the higher doorway of the house of the Lord.
Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah?
In those days the Lord first sent against Judah, Rezin, the king of Aram, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah.
And Jotham went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth in the town of David his father; and Ahaz his son became king in his place.
In the seventeenth year of Pekah, the son of Remaliah, Ahaz, the son of Jotham, became king of Judah.
Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king; he was ruling for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was right in the eyes of the Lord his God, as David his father did.
But he went in the ways of the kings of Israel, and even made his son go through the fire, copying the disgusting ways of the nations whom the Lord had sent out of the land before the children of Israel.
And he made offerings, burning them in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.
Then Rezin, king of Aram, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem to make war; and they made an attack on Ahaz, shutting him in, but were not able to overcome him.
At that time the king of Edom got Elath back for Edom, and sent the Jews out of Elath; and the Edomites came back to Elath where they are living to this day.
So Ahaz sent representatives to Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria, saying, I am your servant and your son; come to my help against the kings of Aram and Israel who have taken up arms against me.
And Ahaz took the silver and gold which were in the house of the Lord and in the king's store-house, and sent them as an offering to the king of Assyria.
And the king of Assyria, in answer to his request, went up against Damascus and took it, and took its people away as prisoners to Kir, and put Rezin to death.
Then King Ahaz went to Damascus for a meeting with Tiglath-pileser , king of Assyria ; and there he saw the altar which was at Damascus ; and King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest a copy of the altar , giving the design of it and all the details
of its structure .
And from the copy King Ahaz sent from Damascus, Urijah made an altar and had it ready by the time King Ahaz came back from Damascus.
And when the king came from Damascus, he saw the altar; and he went up on it and made an offering on it.
He made his burned offering and his meal offering and his drink offering there, draining out the blood of his peace-offerings on the altar.
And the brass altar, which was before the Lord, he took from the front of the house, from between his altar and the house of the Lord, and put it on the north side of his altar.
And King Ahaz gave orders to Urijah the priest , saying , Make the morning burned offering and the evening meal offering and the king ' s burned offering and meal offering , with the burned offerings of all the people and their meal offerings and drink offerings , on
the great altar , and put on it all the blood of the burned offerings and of the beasts which are offered ; but the brass altar will be for my use to get directions from the Lord .
So Urijah the priest did everything as the king said
And King Ahaz took off the sides of the wheeled bases, and took down the great water-vessel from off the brass oxen which were under it and put it on a floor of stone.
*** the house of the Lord, because of the king of Assyria.
Now the rest of the things which Ahaz did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah?
And Ahaz went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth with his fathers in the town of David; and Hezekiah his son became king in his place.
In the twelfth year of Ahaz, king of Judah, Hoshea, the son of Elah, became king over Israel in Samaria, ruling for nine years.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, though not like the kings of Israel before him.
Against him came up Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, and Hoshea became his servant and sent him offerings.
But Hoshea ' s broken faith became clear to the king of Assyria because he had sent representatives to So , king of Egypt , and did not send his offering to the king of Assyria , as he had done year by year : so the king of Assyria
had him shut up in prison and put in chains .
Then the king of Assyria went through all the land and came up to Samaria, shutting it in with his forces for three years.
In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria, and took Israel away to Assyria, placing them in Halah and in Habor on the river Gozan, and in the towns of the Medes.
And the wrath of the Lord came on Israel because they had done evil against the Lord their God, who took them out of the land of Egypt from under the yoke of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and had become worshippers of other gods,
Living by the rules of the nations whom the Lord had sent out from before the children of Israel.
And the children of Israel did secretly against the Lord their God things which were not right, building high places for themselves in all their towns, from the tower of the watchmen to the walled town.
They put up pillars of stone and wood on every high hill and under every green tree:
Burning their offerings in all the high places, as those nations did whom the Lord sent away from before them; they did evil things, moving the Lord to wrath;
And they made themselves servants of disgusting things, though the Lord had said, You are not to do this.
And he gave witness to Israel and Judah , by every prophet and seer , saying , Come back from your evil ways , and do my orders and keep my rules , and be guided by the law which I gave to your fathers and sent to you by
my servants the prophets .
And they did not give ear, but became stiff-necked, like their fathers who had no faith in the Lord their God.
And they went against his rules , and the agreement which he made with their fathers , and his laws which he gave them ; they gave themselves up to things without sense or value , and became foolish like the nations round them , of whom the Lord had
said , Do not as they do .
And turning their backs on all the orders which the Lord had given them, they made for themselves images of metal, and the image of Asherah, worshipping all the stars of heaven and becoming servants to Baal.
And they made their sons and their daughters go through the fire, and they made use of secret arts and unnatural powers, and gave themselves up to doing evil in the eyes of the Lord, till he was moved to wrath.
So the Lord was very angry with Israel, and his face was turned away from them: only the tribe of Judah kept its place.
(But even Judah did not keep the orders of the Lord their God, but were guided by the rules which Israel had made.
So the Lord would have nothing to do with all the offspring of Israel, and sent trouble on them, and gave them up into the hands of their attackers, till he had sent them away from before his face.)
For Israel was broken off from the family of David, and they made Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, king, who, driving them away from the laws of the Lord, made them do a great sin.
And the children of Israel went on with all the sins which Jeroboam did; they did not keep themselves from them;
Till the Lord put Israel away from before his face, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was taken away from their land to Assyria, to this day.
Then the king of Assyria took men from Babylon and from Cuthah and Avva and Hamath and Sepharvaim, and put them in the towns of Samaria in place of the children of Israel; so they got Samaria for their heritage, living in its towns.
Now when first they were living there they did not give worship to the Lord. So the Lord sent lions among them, causing the death of some of them.
So they said to the king of Assyria , The nations whom you have taken as prisoners and put in the towns of Samaria , have no knowledge of the way of the god of the land : so he has sent lions among them , causing their death ,
because they have no knowledge of his way .
Then the king of Assyria gave orders, saying, Send there one of the priests whom you took away, and let him be living there and teaching the people the way of the god of the land.
So one of the priests whom they had taken away as a prisoner from Samaria came back, and, living in Beth-el, became their teacher in the worship of the Lord.
And every nation made gods for themselves, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in the towns where they were living.
The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,
The Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites gave their children to be burned in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
So they went on worshipping the Lord, and made for themselves, from among all the people, priests for the high places, to make offerings for them in the houses of the high places.
They gave worship to the Lord, but they gave honour to their gods like the nations did from whom they had been taken as prisoners.
So to this day they go on in their old ways, not worshipping the Lord or keeping his orders or his ways or the law and the rule which the Lord gave to the children of Jacob, to whom he gave the name Israel;
And the Lord made an agreement with them and gave them orders, saying, You are to have no other gods; you are not to give worship to them or be their servants or make them offerings:
But the Lord, who took you out of the land of Egypt with his great power and his outstretched arm, he is your God, to whom you are to give worship and make offerings:
And the rules and the orders and the law which he put in writing for you, you are to keep and do for ever; you are to have no other gods.
And you are to keep in memory the agreement which I have made with you; and you are to have no other gods.
And you are to give worship to the Lord your God; for it is he who will give you salvation from the hands of all who are against you.
But they gave no attention, but went on in their old way.
So these nations, worshipping the Lord, still were servants to the images they had made; their children and their children's children did the same; as their fathers did, so do they, to this day.
Now in the third year of Hoshea, son of Elah, king of Israel, Hezekiah, the son of Ahaz, became king of Judah.
He was twenty-five years old when he became king, ruling in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years; his mother's name was Abi, the daughter of Zechariah.
He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord as David his father had done.
He had the high places taken away , and the stone pillars broken to bits , and the Asherah cut down ; and the brass snake which Moses had made was crushed to powder at his order , because in those days the children of Israel had offerings burned before
it , and he gave it the name Nehushtan .
He had faith in the Lord, the God of Israel; so that there was no one like him among all the kings of Judah who were before him.
For his heart was fixed on the Lord, not turning from his ways, and he did his orders which the Lord gave to Moses.
And the Lord was with him; he did well in all his undertakings: and he took up arms against the king of Assyria and was his servant no longer.
He overcame the Philistines as far as Gaza and its limits, from the tower of the watchman to the walled town.
Now in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea, son of Elah, king of Israel, Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, came up against Samaria, shutting it in with his armies.
And at the end of three years they took it; in the sixth year of Hezekiah's rule, which was the ninth year of Hoshea, king of Israel, Samaria was taken.
And the king of Assyria took Israel away as prisoners into Assyria, placing them in Halah and in Habor on the river Gozan, and in the towns of the Medes;
Because they did not give ear to the voice of the Lord their God, but went against his agreement, even against everything ordered by Moses, the servant of the Lord, and they did not give ear to it or do it.
Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came up against all the walled towns of Judah and took them.
And Hezekiah , king of Judah , sent to Lachish , to the king of Assyria , saying , I have done wrong ; give up attacking me , and whatever you put on me I will undergo . And the payment he was to make was fixed by the
king of Assyria at three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold .
So Hezekiah gave him all the silver in the house of the Lord, and in the king's store-house.
And at that time Hezekiah had the gold from the doors of the Lord's house, and from the door-pillars plated by him, cut off and gave it to the king of Assyria.
Then the king of Assyria sent the Tartan and the Rab-saris and the Rab-shakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem , to King Hezekiah , with a strong force . And they went up and came to Jerusalem , and took up their position by the stream of the higher pool ,
by the highway of the washerman ' s field .
And they sent for the king, and Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to them.
And the Rab-shakeh said to them, Say now to Hezekiah, These are the words of the great king, the king of Assyria: In what are you placing your hope?
You say you have a design, and strength for war, but these are only words. Now to whom are you looking for support, that you have gone against my authority?
See , now , you are basing your hope on that broken rod of Egypt , which will go through a man ' s hand if he makes use of it for a support ; for so is Pharaoh , king of Egypt , to all who put their faith
in him .
And if you say to me, Our hope is in the Lord our God: is it not he, whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away, saying to Judah and Jerusalem that worship may only be given before this altar in Jerusalem?
And now, take a chance with my master, the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able to put horsemen on them.
How then may you put to shame the least of my master's servants? and you have put your hope in Egypt for war-carriages and horsemen:
And have I now come up to send destruction on this place without the Lord's authority? It was the Lord himself who said to me, Go up against this land and make it waste.
Then Eliakim , the son of Hilkiah , and Shebna and Joah said to the Rab-shakeh , Will you kindly make use of the Aramaean language in talking to your servants , for we are used to it , and do not make use of the Jews ' language in
the hearing of the people on the wall .
But the Rab-shakeh said to them , Is it to your master or to you that my master has sent me to say these words ? has he not sent me to the men seated on the wall ? for they are the people who will be short of food
with you when the town is shut in .
Then the Rab-shakeh got up and said with a loud voice in the Jews' language, Give ear to the words of the great king, the king of Assyria;
This is what the king says: Do not be tricked by Hezekiah, for there is no salvation for you in him.
And do not let Hezekiah make you put your faith in the Lord, saying, The Lord will certainly keep us safe, and this town will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria.
Do not give ear to Hezekiah , for this is what the king of Assyria says : Make peace with me and come out to me ; and everyone will be free to take the fruit of his vine and of his fig-tree , and the water of his spring
Till I come and take you away to a land like yours , a land of grain and wine , a land of bread and vine-gardens , a land of oil-giving olives and of honey , so that life and not death may be your fate . Give no attention
to Hezekiah when he says to you , The Lord will keep us safe .
Has any one of the gods of the nations kept his land from falling into the hands of the king of Assyria?
Where are the gods of Hamath and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena and Ivvah? have they kept Samaria out of my hands?
Who among all the gods of these countries have kept their country from falling into my hands, to give cause for the thought that the Lord will keep Jerusalem from falling into my hands?
But the people kept quiet and gave him no answer: for the king's order was, Give him no answer.
Then Eliakim , the son of Hilkiah , who was over the house , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah , the son of Asaph , the recorder , came to Hezekiah , with their clothing parted as a sign of grief , and gave him an account of
what the Rab-shakeh had said .
And on hearing it, King Hezekiah took off his robe, and put on haircloth, and went into the house of the Lord.
And he sent Eliakim, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the chief priests, dressed in haircloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.
And they said to him, Hezekiah says, This day is a day of trouble and punishment and shame; for the children are ready to come to birth, but there is no strength to give birth to them.
It may be that the Lord your God will give ear to the words of the Rab-shakeh , whom the king of Assyria , his master , sent to say evil things against the living God , and will make his words come to nothing : so then make your
prayer for the rest of the people .
So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
And Isaiah said to them, This is what you are to say to your master: The Lord says, Be not troubled by the words which the servants of the king of Assyria have said against me in your hearing.
See, I will put a spirit into him, and bad news will come to his ears, and he will go back to his land; and there I will have him put to death by the sword.
So the Rab-shakeh went back, and when he got there the king of Assyria was making war against Libnah, for it had come to his ears that he had gone away from Lachish.
And when news came to him that Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia, had made an attack on him, he sent representatives to Hezekiah again, saying,
This is what you are to say to Hezekiah, king of Judah: Let not your God, in whom is your faith, give you a false hope, saying, Jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria.
No doubt the story has come to your ears of what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, putting them to the curse; and will you be kept safe?
Did the gods of the nations keep safe those on whom my fathers sent destruction, Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?
Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the town of Sepharvaim, of Hena and of Ivvah?
And Hezekiah took the letter from the hands of those who had come with it; and after reading it, Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord, opening the letter there before the Lord.
And Hezekiah made his prayer to the Lord, saying, O Lord, the God of Israel, seated between the winged ones, you only are the God of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.
Let your ear be turned to us, O Lord, and let your eyes be open, O Lord, and see; take note of all the words of Sennacherib who has sent men to say evil against the living God.
Truly, O Lord, the kings of Assyria have made waste the nations and their lands,
And have given their gods to the fire; for they were no gods, but wood and stone, the work of men's hands; so they have given them to destruction.
But now, O Lord our God, give us salvation from his hands, so that it may be clear to all the kingdoms of the earth that you and only you, O Lord, are God.
Then Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent to Hezekiah, saying, The Lord, the God of Israel, says, The prayer which you have made to me against Sennacherib, king of Assyria, has come to my ears.
This is the word which the Lord has said about him: In the eyes of the virgin daughter of Zion you are shamed and laughed at; the daughter of Jerusalem has made sport of you.
Against whom have you said evil and bitter things? against whom has your voice been loud and your eyes lifted up? even against the Holy One of Israel.
You have sent your servants with evil words against the Lord , and have said , With all my war-carriages I have come up to the top of the mountains , to the inmost parts of Lebanon ; its tall cedars will be cut down , and the best trees
of its woods ; I will come up into his highest places , into his thick woods .
I have made water-holes and taken their waters, and with my foot I have made all the rivers of Egypt dry.
Has it not come to your ears how I did it long before, purposing it in times long past? Now I have given effect to my design, so that by you strong towns might be turned into masses of broken walls.
This is why their townsmen had no power, they were broken and put to shame; they were like the grass of the field and the green plant, like grass on the house-tops.
But I have knowledge of your getting up and your resting, of your going out and your coming in.
Because your wrath against me and your words of pride have come up to my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my cord in your lips, and I will make you go back by the way you came.
And this will be the sign to you : you will get your food this year from what comes up of itself ; and in the second year from the produce of the same ; and in the third year you will put in your seed and get in the
grain and make vine-gardens and take of their fruit .
And those of Judah who are still living will again take root in the earth and give fruit.
For from Jerusalem those who have been kept safe will go out, and those who are still living will go out of Mount Zion: by the fixed purpose of the Lord of armies this will be done.
For this cause the Lord says about the king of Assyria, He will not come into this town, or send an arrow against it; he will not come before it with arms, or put up an earthwork against it;
By the way he came he will go back, and he will not get into this town, says the Lord.
For I will keep this town safe, for my honour, and for the honour of my servant David.
And that night the angel of the Lord went out and put to death in the army of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand men; and when the people got up early in the morning, there was nothing to be seen but dead bodies.
So Sennacherib, king of Assyria, went back to his place at Nineveh.
And it came about , when he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god , that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer put him to death with the sword ; and they went in flight into the land of Ararat . And Esar-haddon his son became king in his
place .
Now when the Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a great wind, Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
And Elijah said to Elisha, Come no farther for the Lord has sent me to Beth-el. But Elisha said, As the Lord is living and as your soul is living, I will not be parted from you. So they went down to Beth-el.
And at Beth-el the sons of the prophets came out to Elisha and said , Has it been made clear to you that the Lord is going to take away your master from over you today ? And he said , Yes , I have knowledge of it : say
no more .
Then Elijah said to him, Come no farther, for the Lord has sent me to Jericho. But he said, As the Lord is living and as your soul is living, I will not be parted from you. So they went on to Jericho.
And at Jericho the sons of the prophets came up to Elisha and said to him , Has it been made clear to you that the Lord is going to take away your master from over you today ? And he said in answer , Yes , I have knowledge
of it : say no more .
Then Elijah said to him, Come no farther, for the Lord has sent me to Jordan. But he said, As the Lord is living and as your soul is living, I will not be parted from you. So they went on together.
And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went out and took their places facing them a long way off, while the two of them were by the edge of Jordan.
Then Elijah took off his robe, and, rolling it up, gave the water a blow with it, and the waters were parted, flowing back this way and that, so that they went over on dry land.
And when they had come to the other side, Elijah said to Elisha, Say what you would have me do for you before I am taken from you. And Elisha said, Be pleased to let a special measure of your spirit be on me.
And he said, You have made a hard request: still, if you see me when I am taken from you, you will get your desire; but if not, it will not be so.
And while they went on their way, going on talking together, suddenly there were carriages and horses of fire separating them from one another and Elijah went up to heaven in a great wind.
And when Elisha saw it he gave a cry, My father, my father, the carriages of Israel and its horsemen! And he saw him no longer; and he was full of grief.
Then he took up Elijah's robe, which had been dropped from him, and went back till he came to the edge of Jordan.
And he took Elijah ' s robe , which had been dropped from him , and giving the water a blow with it , said , Where is the Lord , the God of Elijah ? and at his blow the waters were parted this way and that ; and
Elisha went over .
And when the sons of the prophets who were facing him at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha. And they came out to him, and went down on the earth before him.
And they said , Your servants have with us here fifty strong men ; be pleased to let them go in search of Elijah ; for it may be that the spirit of the Lord has taken him up and put him down on some mountain or in some valley
. But he said , Do not send them .
But when they kept on requesting him, he was shamed and said, Send, then. So they sent fifty men; but after searching for three days, they came back without having seen him.
And they came back to him, while he was still at Jericho; and he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?
Now the men of the town said to Elisha, You see that the position of this town is good; but the water is bad, causing the young of the cattle to come to birth dead.
So he said, Get me a new vessel, and put salt in it; and they took it to him.
Then he went out to the spring from which the water came, and put salt in it, and said, The Lord says, Now I have made this water sweet; no longer will it be death-giving or unfertile.
And the water was made sweet again to this day, as Elisha said.
Then from there he went up to Beth-el; and on his way, some little boys came out from the town and made sport of him, crying, Go up, old no-hair! go up, old no-hair!
And turning back, he saw them, and put a curse on them in the name of the Lord. And two she-bears came out of the wood and put forty-two of the children to death.
From there he went to Mount Carmel, and came back from there to Samaria.
In those days Hezekiah was ill and near death. And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him, and said to him, The Lord says, Put your house in order, for your death is near.
Then, turning his face to the wall, he made his prayer to the Lord, saying,
O Lord, keep in mind how I have been true to you with all my heart, and have done what is good in your eyes. And Hezekiah gave way to bitter weeping.
Now before Isaiah had gone out of the middle of the town, the word of the Lord came to him, saying,
Go back and say to Hezekiah , the ruler of my people , The Lord , the God of David your father , says , Your prayer has come to my ears , and I have seen your weeping ; see , I will make you well : on the
third day you will go up to the house of the Lord .
I will give you fifteen more years of life; and I will keep you and this town safe from the hands of the king of Assyria; I will keep this town safe, for my honour, and for the honour of my servant David.
Then Isaiah said, Take a cake of figs. So they took it and put it on his wound, and he got better.
And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What is to be the sign that the Lord will make me well, and that I will go up to the house of the Lord on the third day?
And Isaiah said, This is the sign the Lord will give you, that he will do what he has said; will the shade go forward ten degrees or back?
And Hezekiah said in answer, It is a simple thing for the shade to go forward; but let it go back ten degrees.
Then Isaiah the prophet made prayer to the Lord, and he made the shade go back ten degrees from its position on the steps of Ahaz.
At that time, Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters with an offering to Hezekiah, because he had news that Hezekiah had been ill.
And Hezekiah was glad at their coming and let them see all his store of wealth , the silver and the gold and the spices and the oil of great price , and the house of his arms , and everything there was in his stores ; there was nothing
in all his house or his kingdom which Hezekiah did not let them see .
Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, What did these men say and where did they come from? And Hezekiah said, They came from a far country, even from Babylon.
And he said, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah said in answer, They saw everything in my house: there is nothing among my stores which I did not let them see.
And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Give ear to the word of the Lord.
Truly, days are coming when everything in your house, and whatever your fathers have put in store till this day, will be taken away to Babylon: all will be gone, says the Lord.
And your sons, the offspring of your body, they will take away to be unsexed servants in the house of the king of Babylon.
Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, Good is the word of the Lord which you have said. Then he said, ... if in my time there is peace and righteousness?
Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his power, and how he made the pool and the stream, to take water into the town, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah?
And Hezekiah went to rest with his fathers; and Manasseh his son became king in his place.
Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king; for fifty-five years he was ruling in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hephzi-bah.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, copying the disgusting ways of those nations whom the Lord had sent out before the children of Israel.
He put up again the high places which had been pulled down by Hezekiah his father; he made altars for Baal, and an Asherah, as Ahab, king of Israel, had done; he was a worshipper and servant of all the stars of heaven.
And he put up altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord had said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.
And he put up altars for all the stars of heaven in the two outer squares of the house of the Lord.
And he made his son go through the fire , and made use of secret arts and signs for reading the future ; he gave positions to those who had control of spirits and to wonder-workers ; he did much evil in the eyes of the Lord , moving him
to wrath .
He put the image of Asherah which he had made in the house of which the Lord had said to David and to Solomon his son , In this house , and in Jerusalem , the town which I have made mine out of all the tribes of Israel ,
I will put my name for ever .
And never again will I send the feet of Israel wandering from the land which I gave to their fathers; if only they will take care to do all my orders, and keep all the law which my servant Moses gave them.
But they did not give ear; and Manasseh made them do more evil than those nations did, whom the Lord gave up to destruction before the children of Israel.
And the Lord said, by his servants the prophets,
Because Manasseh, king of Judah, has done these disgusting things, doing more evil than all the Amorites before him, and making Judah do evil with his false gods,
For this cause, says the Lord, the God of Israel, I will send such evil on Jerusalem and Judah that the ears of all to whom the news comes will be burning.
And over Jerusalem will be stretched the line of Samaria and the weight of Ahab; Jerusalem will be washed clean as a plate is washed, and turned over on its face.
And I will put away from me the rest of my heritage, and give them up into the hands of their haters, who will take their property and their goods for themselves;
Because they have done evil in my eyes, moving me to wrath, from the day when their fathers came out of Egypt till this day.
More than this, Manasseh took the lives of upright men, till Jerusalem from one end to the other was full of blood; in addition to his sin in making Judah do evil in the eyes of the Lord.
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all he did, and his sins, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah?
So Manasseh went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth in the garden of his house, in the garden of Uzza; and Amon his son became king in his place.
Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, ruling in Jerusalem for two years; his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as Manasseh his father had done.
He went in all the ways of his father, being a servant and worshipper of the false gods to which his father had been a servant;
Turning away from the Lord, the God of his fathers, and not walking in his ways.
And the servants of Amon made a secret design against him, and put the king to death in his house.
But the people of the land put to death all those who had taken part in the design against the king, and made Josiah his son king in his place.
Now the rest of the acts which Amon did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah?
He was put in his last resting-place in the garden of Uzza, and Josiah his son became king in his place.
Josiah was eight years old when he became king; and he was ruling in Jerusalem for thirty-one years; his mother's name was Jedidah, daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.
He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, walking in the ways of David his father, without turning to the right hand or to the left.
Now in the eighteenth year after he became king, Josiah sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the Lord, saying to him,
Go up to Hilkiah, the chief priest, and let him give out the money which is taken into the house of the Lord, which the keepers of the door have got together from the people;
And let it be given to the overseers of the work of the Lord's house, to give to the workmen who are making good what was damaged in the house of the Lord;
To the woodworkers and the builders and the stone-cutters; and for getting wood and cut stones for the building up of the house.
They did not have to give any account of the money which was handed to them, for they made use of it with good faith.
Then Hilkiah, the chief priest, said to Shaphan the scribe, I have made discovery of the book of the law in the house of the Lord. So Hilkiah gave it to Shaphan;
Then , after reading it , Shaphan the scribe went in to the king and gave him an account of what had been done , saying , Your servants have given out the money which was in the house , and have given it to the overseers of the work
of the house of the Lord .
Then Shaphan the scribe said to the king, Hilkiah the priest has given me a book; and he was reading it before the king.
And the king, hearing the words of the book of the law, took his robe in his hands, violently parting it as a sign of his grief;
And he gave orders to Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Achbor, the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying,
Go and get directions from the Lord for me and for the people and for all Judah , about the words of this book which has come to light ; for great is the wrath of the Lord which is burning against us , because our fathers have not given
ear to the words of this book , to do all the things which are recorded in it .
So Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam and Achbor and Shaphan and Asaiah , went to Huldah the woman prophet , the wife of Shallum , the son of Tikvah , the son of Harhas , keeper of the robes , ( now she was living in Jerusalem , in
the second part of the town ; ) and they had talk with her .
And she said to them, The Lord, the God of Israel, says, Say to the man who sent you to me,
These are the words of the Lord: See, I will send evil on this place and on its people, even everything which the king of Judah has been reading in the book;
Because they have given me up, burning offerings to other gods and moving me to wrath by all the work of their hands; so my wrath will be on fire against this place, and will not be put out.
But to the king of Judah who sent you to get directions from the Lord, say, This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, has said: As to the words which have come to your ears,
Because your heart was soft , and you made yourself low before me , when you had word of what I said against this place and its people , that they would become a waste and a curse , and you gave signs of grief , weeping before me :
truly , I have given ear to you , says the Lord .
For this cause I will let you go to your fathers and be put in your last resting-place in peace, and your eyes will not see all the evil which I will send on this place. So they took this news back to the king.
Then the king sent and got together all the responsible men of Judah and of Jerusalem.
And the king went up to the house of the Lord , with all the men of Judah and all the people of Jerusalem , and the priests and the prophets and all the people , small and great ; and they were present at his reading of the book
of the law which had come to light in the house of the Lord .
And the king took his place by the pillar , and made an agreement before the Lord , to go in the way of the Lord , and keep his orders and his decisions and his rules with all his heart and all his soul , and to keep the
words of the agreement recorded in the book ; and all the people gave their word to keep the agreement .
Then the king gave orders to Hilkiah , the chief priest , and to the priests of the second order , and to the keepers of the door , to take out of the house of the Lord all the vessels made for Baal and for the Asherah and for
all the stars of heaven ; and he had them burned outside Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron , and took the dust of them to Beth-el .
And he put an end to the false priests , who had been put in their positions by the kings of Judah to see to the burning of offerings in the high places in the towns of Judah and the outskirts of Jerusalem , and all those who made offerings
to Baal and to the sun and the moon and the twelve signs and all the stars of heaven .
And he took the Asherah from the house of the Lord, outside Jerusalem to the stream Kidron, burning it by the stream and crushing it to dust, and he put the dust on the place where the bodies of the common people were put to rest.
And he had the houses pulled down of those who were used for sex purposes in the house of the Lord, where women were making robes for the Asherah.
And he made all the priests from the towns of Judah come into Jerusalem , and he made unclean the high places where the priests had been burning offerings , from Geba to Beer-sheba ; and he had the high places of the evil spirits pulled down which were by
the doorway of Joshua , the ruler of the town , on the left side of the way into the town .
Still the priests of the high places never came up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem; but they took their food of unleavened bread among their brothers.
And Topheth, in the valley of the sons of Hinnom, he made unclean, so that no man might make his son or his daughter go through the fire to Molech.
And he took away the horses which the kings of Judah had given to the sun , at the way into the house of the Lord , by the room of Nathan-melech , the unsexed servant , which was in the outer part of the building , and the carriages
of the sun he put on fire .
And the altars on the roof of the high room of Ahaz , which the kings of Judah had made , and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two outer squares of the house of the Lord , were pulled down and crushed to bits , and the
dust of them was put into the stream Kidron .
And the high places before Jerusalem , on the south side of the mountain of destruction , which Solomon , king of Israel , had made for Ashtoreth , the disgusting god of the Zidonians , and for Chemosh , the disgusting god of Moab , and for Milcom ,
the disgusting god of the children of Ammon , the king made unclean .
The stone pillars were broken to bits and the wood pillars cut down, and the places where they had been were made full of the bones of the dead.
And the altar at Beth-el , and the high place put up by Jeroboam , the son of Nebat , who made Israel do evil , that altar and that high place were pulled down ; and the high place was burned and crushed to dust and the Asherah was
burned .
Then Josiah , turning round , saw on the mountain the places of the dead , and he sent and had the bones taken out of their places and burned on the altar , so making it unclean , as the Lord had said by the man of God when
Jeroboam was in his place by the altar on that feast-day . And he , turning his eyes to the resting-place of the man of God who had given word of these things , said :
What is that headstone I see over there? And the men of the town said to him, It is the resting-place of the man of God who came from Judah and gave word of all these things which you have done to the altar of Beth-el.
So he said, Let him be; let not his bones be moved. So they let his bones be with the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria.
Then Josiah took away all the houses of the high places in the towns of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had put up, moving the Lord to wrath, and he did with them as he had done in Beth-el.
And all the priests of the high places there he put to death on the altars, burning the bones of the dead on them; and then he went back to Jerusalem.
And the king gave orders to all the people, saying, Keep the Passover to the Lord your God, as it says in this book of the law.
Truly, such a Passover had not been kept in all the days of the judges of Israel or of the kings of Israel or the kings of Judah;
In the eighteenth year of the rule of King Josiah this Passover was kept to the Lord in Jerusalem.
And all those who had control of spirits , and the wonder-workers , and the images , and the false gods , and all the disgusting things which were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem , Josiah put away , so that he might give effect to
the words of the agreement recorded in the book which Hilkiah the priest made discovery of in the house of the Lord .
Never before had there been a king like him, turning to the Lord with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his power, as the law of Moses says; and after him there was no king like him.
But still the heat of the Lord's wrath was not turned back from Judah, because of all Manasseh had done in moving him to wrath.
And the Lord said , I will send Judah away from before my face , as I have sent Israel ; I will have nothing more to do with this town , which I had made mine , even Jerusalem , and the holy house of which I said ,
My name will be there .
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah?
In his days, Pharaoh-necoh, king of Egypt, sent his armies against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates; and King Josiah went out against him; and he put him to death at Megiddo, when he had seen him.
And his servants took his body in a carriage from Megiddo to Jerusalem , and put him into the earth there . And the people of the land took Jehoahaz , the son of Josiah , and put the holy oil on him and made him king in place of
his father .
Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, ruling in Jerusalem for three months; his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as his fathers had done.
And Pharaoh-necoh put him in chains at Riblah in the land of Hamath, so that he might not be king in Jerusalem; and took from the land a tax of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
Then Pharaoh-necoh made Eliakim, the son of Josiah, king in place of Josiah his father, changing his name to Jehoiakim; but Jehoahaz he took away to Egypt, where he was till his death.
And Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh, taxing the land by his orders to get the money; the people of the land had to give silver and gold, everyone as he was taxed, to make the payment to Pharaoh-necoh.
Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king; he was ruling in Jerusalem for eleven years; his mother's name was Zebidah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord as his fathers had done.
In his days, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up and Jehoiakim was his servant for three years; then he took up arms against him.
And the Lord sent against him bands of the Chaldaeans and of the Edomites and of the Moabites and of the children of Ammon; sending them against Judah for its destruction, as he had said by his servants the prophets.
Only by the word of the Lord did this fate come on Judah, to take them away from before his face; because of the sins of Manasseh and all the evil he did;
And because of the death of those who had done no wrong, for he made Jerusalem full of the blood of the upright; and the Lord had no forgiveness for it.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah?
So Jehoiakim went to rest with his fathers; and Jehoiachin his son became king in his place.
And the king of Egypt did not come out of his land again, for the king of Babylon had taken all his country, from the stream of Egypt to the river Euphrates.
Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, he was ruling in Jerusalem for three months, and his mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as his father had done.
At that time the armies of Nebuchadnezzar came up to Jerusalem and the town was shut in on every side.
And Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came there, while his servants were shutting in the town;
Then Jehoiachin, king of Judah, went out to the king of Babylon, with his mother and his servants and his chiefs and his unsexed servants; and in the eighth year of his rule the king of Babylon took him.
And he took away all the stored wealth of the Lord ' s house , and the goods from the king ' s store-house , cutting up all the gold vessels which Solomon , king of Israel , had made in the house of the Lord , as the Lord
had said .
And he took away all the people of Jerusalem and all the chiefs and all the men of war, ten thousand prisoners; and all the expert workmen and the metal-workers; only the poorest sort of the people of the land were not taken away.
He took Jehoiachin a prisoner to Babylon, with his mother and his wives and his unsexed servants and the great men of the land; he took them all as prisoners from Jerusalem to Babylon.
And all the men of war, seven thousand of them, and a thousand expert workmen and metal-workers, all of them strong and able to take up arms, the king of Babylon took away as prisoners into Babylon.
And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, his father's brother, king in place of Jehoiachin, changing his name to Zedekiah.
Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he was king in Jerusalem for eleven years; his mother's name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as Jehoiakim had done.
And because of the wrath of the Lord, this came about in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had sent them all away from before him: and Zedekiah took up arms against the king of Babylon.
Now in the ninth year of his rule, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came against Jerusalem with all his army and took up his position before it, building earthworks all round the town.
And the town was shut in by their forces till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
Now on the ninth day of the fourth month, the store of food in the town was almost gone, so that there was no food for the people of the land.
So an opening was made in the wall of the town , and all the men of war went in flight by night through the doorway between the two walls which was by the king ' s garden ; ( now the Chaldaeans were stationed round the town : )
and the king went by the way of the Arabah .
But the Chaldaean army went after the king, and overtook him in the lowlands of Jericho, and all his army went in flight from him in every direction.
And they made the king a prisoner and took him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah to be judged.
And they put the sons of Zedekiah to death before his eyes, and then they put out his eyes, and chaining him with iron bands, took him to Babylon.
Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem;
And he had the house of the Lord and the king's house and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burned with fire;
And the walls round Jerusalem were broken down by the Chaldaean army which was with the captain.
And the rest of the people who were still in the town, and all those who had given themselves up to the king of Babylon, and all the rest of the workmen, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, took away as prisoners;
But he let the poorest of the land go on living there, to take care of the vines and the fields.
And the brass pillars in the house of the Lord, and the wheeled bases, and the great brass water-vessel in the house of the Lord, were broken up by the Chaldaeans, who took the brass to Babylon.
And the pots and the spades and the scissors for the lights and the spoons, and all the brass vessels used in the Lord's house, they took away.
And the fire-trays and the basins; the gold of the gold vessels and the silver of the silver vessels, were all taken away by the captain of the armed men.
The two pillars, the great water-vessel and the wheeled bases, which Solomon had made for the house of the Lord: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
One of the pillars was eighteen cubits high, with a crown of brass on it; the crown was three cubits high, circled with a network and apples all of brass; and the second pillar had the same.
And the captain of the armed men took Seraiah, the chief priest, and Zephaniah, the second priest, and the three door-keepers;
And from the town he took the unsexed servant who was over the men of war , and five of the king ' s near friends who were in the town , and the scribe of the captain of the army , who was responsible for getting the people of
the land together in military order , and sixty men of the people of the land who were in the town .
These Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, took with him to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
And the king of Babylon put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was taken away prisoner from his land.
As for the people who were still living in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, did not take away, he made Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler over them.
Now the captains of the armed forces , hearing that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah ruler , came with their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah ; Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah , and Johanan , the son of Kareah , and Seraiah , the son of Tanhumeth
the Netophathite , and Jaazaniah , the son of the Maacathite , came with all their men .
Then Gedaliah gave his oath to them and their men, saying, Have no fear because of the servants of the Chaldaeans; go on living in the land under the rule of the king of Babylon, and all will be well.
But in the seventh month , Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the king ' s seed , came with ten men and made an attack on Gedaliah , causing his death and the death of the Jews and the Chaldaeans who were
with him at Mizpah .
Then all the people, small and great, and the captains of the forces, got up and went away to Egypt, for fear of the Chaldaeans.
And in the thirty-seventh year after Jehoiachin , king of Judah , had been taken prisoner , in the twelfth month , on the twenty-seventh day of the month , Evil-merodach , king of Babylon , in the first year of his rule , took Jehoiachin , king of Judah
, out of prison ;
And said kind words to him, and put his seat higher than the seats of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.
And his prison clothing was changed, and he was a guest at the king's table every day for the rest of his life.
And for his food, the king gave him a regular amount every day for the rest of his life.
And Jehoram, the son of Ahab, became king over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of the rule of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah; and he was king for twelve years.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord; but not like his father and his mother, for he put away the stone pillar of Baal which his father had made.
But still he did the same sins which Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, did and made Israel do; he went on in them.
Now Mesha, king of Moab, was a sheep-farmer; and he gave regularly to the king of Israel the wool from a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand sheep.
But when Ahab was dead, the king of Moab got free from the authority of the king of Israel.
At that time, King Jehoram went out from Samaria and got all Israel together in fighting order.
And he sent to Jehoshaphat , king of Judah , saying , The king of Moab has got free from my authority : will you go with me to make war on Moab ? And he said , I will go with you : I am as you are ,
my people as your people , and my horses as your horses .
And he said, Which way are we to go? And he said in answer, By the waste land of Edom.
So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom by a roundabout way for seven days: and there was no water for the army or for the beasts they had with them.
And the king of Israel said, Here is trouble: for the Lord has got these three kings together to give them into the hands of Moab.
But Jehoshaphat said , Is there no prophet of the Lord here , through whom we may get directions from the Lord ? And one of the king of Israel ' s men said in answer , Elisha , the son of Shaphat , is here , who was servant
to Elijah .
And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the Lord is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
But Elisha said to the king of Israel , What have I to do with you ? go to the prophets of your father and your mother . And the king of Israel said , No ; for the Lord has got these three kings together to give them up
into the hands of Moab .
Then Elisha said, By the life of the Lord of armies whose servant I am, if it was not for the respect I have for Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, I would not give a look at you, or see you.
But now , get me a player of music , and it will come about that while the man is playing , the hand of the Lord will come on me and I will give you the word of the Lord : and they got a player of music ,
and while the man was playing , the hand of the Lord was on him .
And he said, The Lord says, I will make this valley full of water-holes.
For the Lord says, Though you see no wind or rain, the valley will be full of water, and you and your armies and your beasts will have drink.
And this will be only a small thing to the Lord: in addition he will give the Moabites into your hands.
And you are to put every walled town to destruction, cutting down every good tree, and stopping up every water-spring, and making all the good land rough with stones.
Now in the morning, about the time when the offering was made, they saw water flowing from the direction of Edom till the country was full of water.
Now all Moab, hearing that the kings had come to make war against them, got together all who were able to take up arms and went forward to the edge of the country.
And early in the morning they got up, when the sun was shining on the water, and they saw the water facing them as red as blood.
Then they said, This is blood: it is clear that destruction has come on the kings; they have been fighting one another: now come, Moab, let us take their goods.
But when they came to the tents of Israel, the Israelites came out and made a violent attack on the Moabites, so that they went in flight before them; and they went forward still attacking them;
Pulling down the towns , covering every good field with stones , stopping up all the water-springs , and cutting down all the good trees ; they went on driving Moab before them till only in Kir-hareseth were there any Moabites ; and the fighting-men went round the town raining
stones on it .
And when the king of Moab saw that the fight was going against him, he took with him seven hundred men armed with swords, with the idea of forcing a way through to the king of Aram, but they were not able to do so.
Then he took his oldest son, who would have been king after him, offering him as a burned offering on the wall. So there was great wrath against Israel; and they went away from him, back to their country.
Now a certain woman , the wife of one of the sons of the prophets , came crying to Elisha and said , Your servant my husband is dead ; and to your knowledge he was a worshipper of the Lord ; but now , the creditor has come to
take my two children as servants in payment of his debt .
Then Elisha said to her, What am I to do for you? say now, what have you in the house? And she said, Your servant has nothing in the house but a pot of oil.
Then he said, Go out to all your neighbours and get vessels, a very great number of them.
Then go in, and, shutting the door on yourself and your sons, put oil into all these vessels, putting on one side the full ones.
So she went away, and when the door was shut on her and her sons, they took the vessels to her and she put oil into them.
And when all the vessels were full, she said to her son, Get me another vessel. And he said, There are no more. And the flow of oil was stopped.
So she came to the man of God and gave him word of what she had done. And he said, Go and get money for the oil and make payment of your debt, and let the rest be for the needs of yourself and your sons.
Now there came a day when Elisha went to Shunem , and there was a woman of high position living there , who made him come in and have a meal with her . And after that , every time he went by , he went into her house for
a meal .
And she said to her husband, Now I see that this is a holy man of God, who comes by day after day.
So let us make a little room on the wall; and put a bed there for him, and a table and a seat and a light; so that when he comes to us, he will be able to go in there.
Now one day, when he had gone there, he went into the little room and took his rest there.
And he said to Gehazi, his servant, Send for this Shunammite. So in answer to his voice she came before him.
And he said to him , Now say to her , See , you have taken all this trouble for us ; what is to be done for you ? will you have any request made for you to the king or the captain of the army ? But she
said , I am living among my people .
So he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi made answer, Still there is this, she has no son and her husband is old.
Then he said, Send for her. And in answer to his voice she took her place at the door.
And Elisha said, At this time in the coming year you will have a son in your arms. And she said, No, my lord, O man of God, do not say what is false to your servant.
Then the woman became with child and gave birth to a son at the time named, in the year after, as Elisha had said to her.
Now one day, when the child was older, he went out to his father to where the grain was being cut.
And he said to his father, My head, my head! And the father said to a servant, Take him in to his mother.
And he took him in to his mother, and she took him on her knees and kept him there till the middle of the day, when his life went from him.
Then she went up and put him on the bed of the man of God, shutting the door on him, and went out.
And she said to her husband, Send me one of the servants and one of the asses so that I may go quickly to the man of God and come back again.
And he said, Why are you going to him today? it is not a new moon or a Sabbath. But she said, It is well.
Then she made the ass ready and said to her servant, Keep driving on; do not make a stop without orders from me.
So she went, and came to Mount Carmel, to the man of God. And when the man of God saw her coming in his direction, he said to Gehazi, his servant, See, there is the Shunammite;
Go quickly to her, and on meeting her say to her, Are you well? and your husband and the child, are they well? And she said in answer, All is well.
And when she came to where the man of God was on the hill , she put her hands round his feet ; and Gehazi came near with the purpose of pushing her away ; but the man of God said , Let her be , for her soul is
bitter in her ; and the Lord has kept it secret from me , and has not given me word of it .
Then she said, Did I make a request to my lord for a son? did I not say, Do not give me false words?
Then he said to Gehazi , Make yourself ready , and take my stick in your hand , and go : if you come across anyone on the way , give him no blessing , and if anyone gives you a blessing , give him no answer . And put
my stick on the child ' s face .
But the mother of the child said, As the Lord is living and as your soul is living, I will not go back without you. So he got up and went with her.
And Gehazi went on before them and put the stick on the child's face; but there was no voice, and no one gave attention. So he went back, and meeting him gave him the news, saying, The child is not awake.
And when Elisha came into the house he saw the child dead, stretched on his bed.
So he went in, and shutting the door on the two of them, made prayer to the Lord.
Then he got up on the bed, stretching himself out on the child, and put his mouth on the child's mouth, his eyes on his eyes and his hands on his hands; and the child's body became warm.
Then he came back, and after walking once through the house and back, he went up, stretching himself out on the child seven times; and the child's eyes became open.
And he gave orders to Gehazi, and said, Send for the Shunammite. And she came in answer to his voice. And he said, Take up your son.
And she came in, and went down on her face to the earth at his feet; then she took her son in her arms and went out.
And Elisha went back to Gilgal , now there was very little food in the land ; and the sons of the prophets were seated before him . And he said to his servant , Put the great pot on the fire , and make soup for the sons of
the prophets .
And one went out into the field to get green plants and saw a vine of the field , and pulling off the fruit of it till the fold of his robe was full , he came back and put the fruit , cut up small , into the pot
of soup , having no idea what it was .
Then they gave the men soup from the pot. And while they were drinking the soup, they gave a cry, and said, O man of God, there is death in the pot; and they were not able to take any more food.
But he said, Get some meal. And he put it into the pot, and said, Now give it to the people so that they may have food. And there was nothing bad in the pot.
Now a man came from Baal-shalishah with an offering of first-fruits for the man of God, twenty barley cakes and garden fruit in his bag. And he said, Give these to the people for food.
But his servant said, How am I to put this before a hundred men? But he said, Give it to the people for food; for the Lord says, There will be food for them and some over.
So he put it before them, and they had a meal and there was more than enough, as the Lord had said.
Now Naaman, chief of the army of the king of Aram, was a man of high position with his master, and greatly respected, because by him the Lord had given salvation to Aram; but he was a leper.
Now the Aramaeans had gone out in bands, and taken prisoner from Israel a little girl, who became servant to Naaman's wife.
And she said to her master's wife, If only my lord would go to the prophet in Samaria, he would make him well.
And someone went and said to his lord, This is what the girl from the land of Israel says.
So the king of Aram said, Go then; and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he went, taking with him ten talents of silver and six thousand shekels of gold, and ten changes of clothing.
And he took the letter to the king of Israel, in which the king of Aram had said, See, I have sent my servant Naaman to you to be made well, for he is a leper.
But the king of Israel , after reading the letter , was greatly troubled and said , Am I God , to give death and life ? why does this man send a leper to me to be made well ? is it not clear that he is looking for
a cause of war ?
Now Elisha, the man of God, hearing that the king of Israel had done this, sent to the king, saying, Why are you troubled? send the man to me, so that he may see that there is a prophet in Israel.
So Naaman, with all his horses and his carriages, came to the door of Elisha's house.
And Elisha sent a servant to him, saying, Go to Jordan, and after washing seven times in its waters your flesh will be well again and you will be clean.
But Naaman was angry and went away and said , I had the idea that he would come out to see such an important person as I am , and make prayer to the Lord his God , and with a wave of his hand over the place make the
leper well .
Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not be washed in them and become clean? So turning, he went away in wrath.
Then his servants came to him and said, If the prophet had given you orders to do some great thing, would you not have done it? how much more then, when he says to you, Be washed and become clean?
Then he went down seven times into the waters of Jordan, as the man of God had said; and his flesh became like the flesh of a little child again, and he was clean.
Then he went back to the man of God , with all his train , and , taking his place before him , said , Now I am certain that there is no God in all the earth , but only in Israel : now then , take an offering
from me .
But he said, By the life of the Lord whose servant I am, I will take nothing from you. And he did his best to make him take it but he would not.
Then Naaman said , If you will not , then let there be given to your servant as much earth as two beasts are able to take on their backs ; because from now on , your servant will make no offering or burned offering to other gods , but
only to the Lord .
But may your servant have the Lord ' s forgiveness for this one thing : when my master goes into the house of Rimmon for worship there , supported on my arm , and my head is bent in the house of Rimmon ; when his head is bent in
the house of Rimmon , may your servant have the Lord ' s forgiveness for this thing .
And he said to him, Go in peace. And he went from him some distance.
But Gehazi , the servant of Elisha , the man of God , said , Now my master has taken nothing from Naaman , this Aramaean , of what he would have given him : by the living Lord , I will go after him and get something from him
So Gehazi went after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he got down from his carriage and went back to him and said, Is all well?
And he said , All is well : but my master has sent me , saying , Even now , two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim ; will you give me a talent of silver and two changes
of clothing for them ?
And Naaman said, Be good enough to take two talents. And forcing him to take them, he put two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and gave them to his two servants to take before him.
When he came to the hill, he took them from their hands, and put them away in the house; and he sent the men away, and they went.
Then he came in and took his place before his master. And Elisha said to him, Where have you come from, Gehazi? And he said, Your servant went nowhere.
And he said to him , Did not my heart go with you , when the man got down from his carriage and went back to you ? Is this a time for getting money , and clothing , and olive-gardens and vine-gardens , and sheep and oxen , and
men-servants and women-servants ?
Because of what you have done, the disease of Naaman the leper will take you in its grip, and your seed after you, for ever. And he went out from before him a leper as white as snow.
Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, There is not room enough for us in the place where we are living under your care;
So let us go to Jordan, and let everyone get to work cutting boards, and we will make a living-place for ourselves there. And he said to them, Go, then.
And one of them said, Be pleased to go with your servants. And he said, I will go.
So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they got to work cutting down trees.
But one of them, while cutting a board, let the head of his axe go into the water; and he gave a cry, and said, This is a bad business, my master, for it is another's.
And the man of God said, Where did it go in? and when he saw the place where it had gone into the water, cutting a stick, he put it into the water, and the iron came up to the top of the water.
Then he said, Take it up. So he put out his hand and took it.
At that time the king of Aram was making war against Israel; and he had a meeting with the chiefs of his army and said, I will be waiting in secret in some named place.
And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, Take care to keep away from that place, for the Aramaeans are waiting there in secret.
So the king of Israel sent to the place where the man of God had said there was danger, and kept clear of it more than once.
And at this, the mind of the king of Aram was greatly troubled, and he sent for his servants and said to them, Will you not make clear to me which of us is helping the king of Israel?
And one of them said, Not one of us, my lord king; but Elisha, the prophet in Israel, gives the king of Israel news of the words you say even in your bedroom.
Then he said, Go and see where he is, so that I may send and get him. And news came to him that he was in Dothan.
So he sent there horses and carriages and a great army; and they came by night, circling the town.
Now the servant of the man of God, having got up early and gone out, saw an army with horses and carriages of war all round the town. And the servant said to him, O my master, what are we to do?
And he said in answer, Have no fear; those who are with us are more than those who are with them.
Then Elisha made a prayer to the Lord , saying , Lord , let his eyes be open so that he may see . And the Lord made the young man ' s eyes open ; and he saw that all the mountain was full of horses and carriages of
fire round Elisha .
Now when the Aramaeans came down to Elisha, he made a prayer to the Lord saying, Lord, make this people blind. And he made them blind at Elisha's request.
And Elisha said to them, This is not the way, and this is not the town: come after me so that I may take you to the man you are searching for. And he took them to Samaria.
And when they had come into Samaria, Elisha said, Lord, let the eyes of these men be open so that they may see. And the Lord made their eyes open, and they saw that they were in the middle of Samaria.
And the king of Israel, when he saw them, said to Elisha, My father, am I to put them to the sword?
But he said in answer , You are not to put them to death ; have you any right to put to death those whom you have not taken prisoner with your sword and your bow ? put bread and water before them , so that they may have food
and drink and go to their master .
So he made ready a great feast for them, and when they had had food and drink, he sent them away and they went back to their master. And no more bands of Aramaeans came into the land of Israel.
Now after this, Ben-hadad, king of Aram, got together all his army and went up to make an attack on Samaria, shutting the town in on all sides with his forces.
And they became very short of food in Samaria; for they kept it shut in till the price of an ass's head was eighty shekels of silver, and a small measure of doves' droppings was five shekels of silver.
And when the king of Israel was going by on the wall, a woman came crying out to him, and said, Help! my lord king.
And he said, If the Lord does not give you help, where am I to get help for you? from the grain-floor or the grape-crusher?
And the king said to her, What is troubling you? And she said in answer, This woman said to me, Give your son to be our food today, and we will have my son tomorrow.
So, boiling my son, we had a meal of him; and on the day after I said to her, Now give your son for our food; but she has put her son in a secret place.
Then the king, hearing what the woman said, took his robes in his hands, violently parting them; and, while he was walking on the wall, the people, looking, saw that under his robe he had haircloth on his flesh.
Then he said, May God's punishment come on me if Elisha, the son of Shaphat, keeps his head on his body after this day.
But Elisha was in his house, and the responsible men were seated there with him; and before the king got there, Elisha said to those who were with him, Do you see how this cruel and violent man has sent to take away my life?
While he was still talking to them, the king came down and said, This evil is from the Lord; why am I to go on waiting any longer for the Lord?
Then Elisha said , Give ear to the word of the Lord : the Lord says , Tomorrow , about this time , a measure of good meal will be offered for the price of a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel , in the market-place of
Samaria .
Then the captain whose arm was supporting the king said to the man of God , Even if the Lord made windows in heaven , would such a thing be possible ? And he said , Your eyes will see it , but you will not have a taste of
the food .
Now there were four lepers seated at the doorway into the town: and they said to one another, Why are we waiting here for death?
If we say , We will go into the town , there is no food in the town , and we will come to our end there ; and if we go on waiting here , death will come to us . Come then , let us give ourselves up
to the army of Aram : if they let us go on living , then life will be ours ; and if they put us to death , then death will be ours .
So in the half light they got up to go to the tents of Aram; but when they came to the outer line of tents, there was no one there.
For the Lord had made the sound of carriages and horses , and the noise of a great army , come to the ears of the Aramaeans , so that they said to one another , Truly , the king of Israel has got the kings of the Hittites and
of the Egyptians for a price to make an attack on us .
So they got up and went in flight, in the half light, without their tents or their horses or their asses or any of their goods; they went in flight, fearing for their lives.
And when those lepers came to the outer line of tents , they went into one tent , and had food and drink , and took from it silver and gold and clothing , which they put in a secret place ; then they came back and went into another
tent from which they took more goods , which they put away in a secret place .
Then they said to one another , We are not doing right . Today is a day of good news , and we say nothing : if we go on waiting here till the morning , punishment will come to us . So let us go and give the news
to those of the king ' s house .
So they came in , and , crying out to the door-keepers of the town , they gave them the news , saying , We came to the tents of the Aramaeans , and there was no one there and no voice of man , only the horses and the
asses in their places , and the tents as they were .
Then the door-keepers, crying out, gave the news to those inside the king's house.
Then the king got up in the night and said to his servants , This is my idea of what the Aramaeans have done to us . They have knowledge that we are without food ; and so they have gone out of their tents , and are waiting secretly
in the open country , saying , When they come out of the town , we will take them living and get into the town .
And one of his servants said in answer , Send men and let them take five of the horses which we still have in the town ; if they keep their lives they will be the same as those of Israel who are still living here ; if they come
to their death they will be the same as all those of Israel who have gone to destruction : let us send and see .
So they took two horsemen; and the king sent them after the army of the Aramaeans, saying, Go and see.
And they went after them as far as Jordan; and all the road was covered with clothing and vessels dropped by the Aramaeans in their flight. So those who were sent went back and gave the news to the king.
Then the people went out and took the goods from the tents of the Aramaeans. So a measure of good meal was to be had for the price of a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, as the Lord had said.
And the king gave authority to that captain , on whose arm he was supported , to have control over the doorway into the town ; but he was crushed to death there under the feet of the people , as the man of God had said when the king
went down to him .
So the words of the man of God came true , which he said to the king : Two measures of barley will be offered for the price of a shekel and a measure of good meal for a shekel , tomorrow about this time in the market-place of Samaria
And that captain said to the man of God, Even if the Lord made windows in heaven, would such a thing be possible? And he said to him, Your eyes will see it, but you will not have a taste of the food.
And such was his fate; for he was crushed to death under the feet of the people, in the doorway into the town.
Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had given back to life , Go now , with all the people of your house , and get a living-place for yourselves wherever you are able ; for by the word of the Lord , there will be great
need of food in the land ; and this will go on for seven years .
So the woman got up and did as the man of God said; and she and the people of her house were living in the land of the Philistines for seven years.
And when the seven years were ended, the woman came back from the land of the Philistines and went to the king with a request for her house and her land.
Now the king was talking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, Now, give me an account of all the great things Elisha has done.
And while he was giving the king the story of how Elisha had given life to the dead , the woman whose son had come back to life came to the king with a request for her house and her land . And Gehazi said , My lord king ,
this is the woman and this is her son , whose life Elisha gave back to him .
And in answer to the king ' s questions , the woman gave him all the story . So the king gave orders to one of his unsexed servants , saying , Give her back all her property , and all the produce of her fields from the day when
she went away from the land up till now .
And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad, king of Aram, was ill; and they said to him, The man of God has come.
Then the king said to Hazael, Take an offering with you, and go to see the man of God and get directions from the Lord by him, saying, Am I going to get better from my disease?
So Hazael went to see him , taking with him forty camels with offerings on their backs of every sort of good thing from Damascus ; and when he came before him , he said , Your son Ben-hadad , king of Aram , has sent me to you ,
saying , Will I get better from this disease ?
And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, You will certainly get better; but the Lord has made it clear to me that only death is before him.
And he kept his eyes fixed on him till he was shamed, and the man of God was overcome with weeping.
And Hazael said , Why is my lord weeping ? Then he said in answer , Because I see the evil which you will do to the children of Israel : burning down their strong towns , putting their young men to death with the sword , smashing their little
ones against the stones , and cutting open the women who are with child .
And Hazael said, How is it possible that your servant, who is only a dog, will do this great thing? And Elisha said, The Lord has made it clear to me that you will be king over Aram.
Then he went away from Elisha and came in to his master, who said to him, What did Elisha say to you? And his answer was, He said that you would certainly get well.
Now on the day after, Hazael took the bed-cover, and making it wet with water, put it over Ben-hadad's face, causing his death: and Hazael became king in his place.
In the fifth year of Joram, the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, became king.
He was thirty-two years old when he became king; and he was ruling in Jerusalem for eight years.
He went in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the family of Ahab did: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife; and he did evil in the eyes of the Lord.
But it was not the Lord's purpose to send destruction on Judah, because of David his servant, to whom he had given his word that he would have a light for ever.
In his time, Edom made themselves free from the rule of Judah, and took a king for themselves.
Then Joram went over to Zair, with all his war-carriages; ... made an attack by night on the Edomites, whose forces were all round him, ... the captains of the war-carriages; and the people went in flight to their tents.
So Edom made themselves free from the rule of Judah to this day. And at the same time, Libnah made itself free.
Now the rest of the acts of Joram, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah?
And Joram went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth with his fathers in the town of David: and Ahaziah his son became king in his place.
In the twelfth year that Joram, the son of Ahab, was king of Israel, Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, became king;
Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for one year. His mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri, king of Israel.
He went in the ways of the family of Ahab, and did evil in the eyes of the Lord as the family of Ahab did, for he was a son-in-law of the family of Ahab.
He went with Joram, the son of Ahab, to make war on Hazael, king of Aram, at Ramoth-gilead: and Joram was wounded by the Aramaeans.
So King Joram went back to Jezreel to get well from the wounds which the bowmen had given him at Ramah , when he was fighting against Hazael , king of Aram . And Ahaziah , the son of Jehoram , king of Judah , went down to see Joram
, the son of Ahab , in Jezreel , because he was ill .
And Elisha the prophet sent for one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, Make yourself ready for a journey, and take this bottle of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead.
And when you get there, go in search of Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi; and go in and make him get up from among his brothers, and take him to an inner room.
Then take the bottle and put the oil on his head, and say, The Lord says, I have put the holy oil on you to make you king over Israel. Then, opening the door, go in flight, without waiting.
So the young prophet went to Ramoth-gilead.
And when he came, he saw the captains of the army seated together; and he said, I have something to say to you, O captain. And Jehu said, To which of us? And he said, To you, O captain.
And he got up and went into the house; then he put the holy oil on his head and said to him, The Lord, the God of Israel, says, I have made you king over the people of the Lord, over Israel.
You are to see that the family of Ahab your master is cut off, so that I may take from Jezebel payment for the blood of my servants the prophets, and for the blood of all the servants of the Lord.
For the family of Ahab will come to an end; every male of Ahab's family will be cut off, he who is shut up and he who goes free in Israel.
I will make the family of Ahab like that of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and Baasha, the son of Ahijah.
And Jezebel will become food for the dogs in the heritage of Jezreel, and there will be no one to put her body into the earth. Then, opening the door, he went in flight.
Then Jehu came out again to the servants of his lord , and one said to him , Is all well ? why did this man , who is off his head , come to you ? And he said to them , You have knowledge of the man and
of his talk .
And they said, That is not true; now give us his story. Then he said, This is what he said to me: The Lord says, I have made you king over Israel.
Then straight away everyone took his robe and put it under him on the top of the steps, and, sounding the horn, they said, Jehu is king.
So Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, made designs against Joram. (Now Joram and all the army of Israel were keeping watch on Ramoth-gilead because of Hazael, king of Aram:
But King Joram had gone back to Jezreel to get well from the wounds which the Aramaeans had given him when he was fighting against Hazael , king of Aram . ) And Jehu said , If this is your purpose , then let no one get away and go
out of the town to give news of it in Jezreel .
So Jehu got into his carriage and went to Jezreel, for Joram was ill in bed there; and Ahaziah, king of Judah, had come down to see Joram.
And the watchman on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu and his band coming, and said, I see a band of people. And Joram said, Send out a horseman to them, and let him say, Is it peace?
So a horseman went out to them and said , The king says , Is it peace ? And Jehu said , What have you to do with peace ? come after me . And the watchman gave them word , saying , The horseman went up to them ,
but has not come back .
Then he sent out a second horseman, who came up to them and said, The king says, Is it peace? And Jehu said in answer, What have you to do with peace? come after me.
And the watchman gave them word, saying, He went up to them and has not come back again; and the driving is like the driving of Jehu, son of Nimshi, for he is driving violently.
Then Joram said , Make ready . So they made his carriage ready ; and Joram , king of Israel , with Ahaziah , king of Judah , went out in their carriages for the purpose of meeting Jehu ; and they came face to face with him at the
field of Naboth the Jezreelite .
Now when Joram saw Jehu he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he said in answer, What peace is possible while all the land is full of the disgusting sins of your mother Jezebel, and her secret arts?
Then Joram, turning his horses in flight, said to Ahaziah, Broken faith, O Ahaziah!
Then Jehu took his bow in his hand, and with all his strength sent an arrow, wounding Joram between the arms; and the arrow came out at his heart, and he went down on his face in his carriage.
Then Jehu said to Bidkar , his captain , Take him up , and put him in the field of Naboth the Jezreelite : for is not that day in your memory when you and I together on our horses were going after Ahab , his father , and the
Lord put this fate on him , saying :
I saw the blood of Naboth and of his sons yesterday; and I will give you full payment in this field, says the Lord? So now, take him and put him in this field, as the Lord said.
Now when Ahaziah , king of Judah , saw this , he went in flight by the way of the garden house . And Jehu came after him and said , Put him to death in the same way ; and they gave him a death-wound in his carriage ,
on the slope up to Gur , by Ibleam ; and he went in flight to Megiddo , where death came to him .
And his servants took him in a carriage to Jerusalem, and put him into the earth with his fathers in the town of David.
(In the eleventh year of the rule of Joram, the son of Ahab, Ahaziah became king over Judah.)
And when Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel had news of it; and, painting her eyes and dressing her hair with ornaments, she put her head out of the window.
And when Jehu was coming into the town, she said, Is all well, O Zimri, taker of your master's life?
Then, looking up to the window, he said, Who is on my side, who? and two or three unsexed servants put out their heads.
And he said, Take her and put her out of the window. So they sent her down with force, and her blood went in a shower on the wall and on the horses; and she was crushed under their feet.
And he came in, and took food and drink; then he said, Now see to this cursed woman, and put her body into the earth, for she is a king's daughter.
And they went out to put her body into the earth, but nothing of her was to be seen, only the bones of her head, and her feet, and parts of her hands.
So they came back and gave him word of it. And he said, This is what the Lord said by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the heritage of Jezreel the flesh of Jezebel will become food for dogs;
And the dead body of Jezebel will be like waste dropped on the face of the earth in the heritage of Jezreel; so that they will not be able to say, This is Jezebel.
Now after the death of Saul, when David, having come back from the destruction of the Amalekites, had been in Ziklag for two days;
On the third day a man came from Saul's tents, with his clothing out of order and earth on his head: and when he came to David, he went down on the earth and gave him honour.
And David said to him, Where have you come from? And he said, I have come in flight from the tents of Israel.
And David said to him, How did things go? Give me the news. And in answer he said, The people have gone in flight from the fight, and a great number of them are dead; and Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.
And David said to the young man who gave him the news, Why are you certain that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?
And the young man said, I came by chance to Mount Gilboa, and I saw Saul supporting himself on his spear; and the war-carriages and horsemen overtook him.
And looking back, he saw me and gave a cry to me. And answering him I said, Here am I.
And he said to me, Who are you? And I said, I am an Amalekite.
Then he said to me, Come here to my side, and put me to death, for the pain of death has me in its grip but my life is still strong in me.
So I put my foot on him and gave him his death-blow , because I was certain that he would not go on living after his fall : and I took the crown from his head and the band from his arm , and I have them here for my
lord .
Then David gave way to bitter grief, and so did all the men who were with him:
And till evening they gave themselves to sorrow and weeping , and took no food , weeping for Saul and for Jonathan , his son , and for the people of the Lord and for the men of Israel ; because they had come to their end by the sword
And David said to the young man who had given him the news, Where do you come from? And he said, I am the son of a man from a strange land; I am an Amalekite.
And David said to him, Had you no fear of stretching out your hand to put to death the one marked with the holy oil?
And David sent for one of his young men and said, Go near and put an end to him. And he put him to death.
And David said to him, May your blood be on your head; for your mouth has given witness against you, saying, I have put to death the man marked with the holy oil.
Then David made this song of grief for Saul and Jonathan, his son:
(It is recorded in the book of Jashar for teaching to the sons of Judah) and he said:
The glory, O Israel, is dead on your high places! How have the great ones been made low!
Give no news of it in Gath, let it not be said in the streets of Ashkelon; or the daughters of the Philistines will be glad, the daughters of men without circumcision will be uplifted in joy.
O mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew or rain on you, you fields of death: for there the arms of the strong have been shamed, the arms of Saul, as if he had not been marked with the holy oil.
From the blood of the dead, from the fat of the strong, the bow of Jonathan was not turned back, the sword of Saul did not come back unused.
Saul and Jonathan were loved and pleasing; in their lives and in their death they were not parted; they went more quickly than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
O daughters of Israel, have sorrow for Saul, by whom you were delicately clothed in robes of red, with ornaments of gold on your dresses.
How have the great ones been made low in the fight! Jonathan is dead on your high places.
I am full of grief for you, my brother Jonathan: very dear have you been to me: your love for me was a wonder, greater than the love of women.
How have the great ones been made low, and the arms of war broken!
Now after this, death came to the king of the children of Ammon, and Hanun, his son, became king in his place.
And David said , I will be a friend to Hanun , the son of Nahash , as his father was a friend to me . So David sent his servants , to give him words of comfort on account of his father . And David ' s servants came
into the land of the children of Ammon .
But the chiefs of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord , Does it seem to you that David is honouring your father by sending comforters to you ? has he not sent his servants to go through the town and make secret observation of it , and
overcome it ?
So Hanun took David's servants, and after cutting off half the hair on their chins, and cutting off the skirts of their robes up to the middle, he sent them away.
When David had news of it, he sent men out with the purpose of meeting them on their way, for the men were greatly shamed: and the king said, Go to Jericho till your hair is long again, and then come back.
And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves hated by David , they sent to the Aramaeans of Beth-rehob and Zobah , and got for payment twenty thousand footmen , and they got from the king of Maacah a thousand men , and from Tob twelve
thousand .
And hearing of this, David sent Joab and all the army and the best fighting-men.
And the children of Ammon came out and put their forces in position at the way into the town: and the Aramaeans of Zobah and of Rehob, with the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.
Now when Joab saw that their forces were in position against him in front and at his back, he took the best of the men of Israel and put them in line against the Aramaeans;
And the rest of the people he put in position against the children of Ammon, with Abishai, his brother, at their head.
And he said, If the Aramaeans are stronger and get the better of me, then you are to come to my help; but if the children of Ammon get the better of you, I will come to your help.
Take heart, and let us be strong for our people and for the towns of our God, and may the Lord do what seems good to him.
Then Joab and the people with him went forward to the fight against the Aramaeans, and they went in flight before him.
And when the children of Ammon saw the flight of the Aramaeans, they themselves went in flight from Abishai, and came into the town. So Joab went back from fighting the children of Ammon and came to Jerusalem.
And when the Aramaeans saw that Israel had overcome them, they got themselves together.
And Hadadezer sent for the Aramaeans who were on the other side of the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach, the captain of Hadadezer's army, at their head.
And word of this was given to David: and he got all Israel together and went over Jordan and came to Helam. And the Aramaeans put their forces in position against David, and made an attack on him.
And the Aramaeans went in flight before Israel; and David put to the sword the men of seven hundred Aramaean war-carriages and forty thousand footmen, and Shobach, the captain of the army, was wounded, and came to his death there.
And when all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer saw that they were overcome by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became their servants. So the Aramaeans, in fear, gave no more help to the children of Ammon.
Now in the spring , at the time when kings go out to war , David sent Joab and his servants and all Israel with him ; and they made waste the land of the children of Ammon , and took up their position before Rabbah , shutting it in
. But David was still at Jerusalem .
Now one evening, David got up from his bed, and while he was walking on the roof of the king's house, he saw from there a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful.
And David sent to get knowledge who the woman was. And one said, Is this not Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam and wife of Uriah the Hittite?
And David sent and took her; and she came to him, and he took her to his bed: (for she had been made clean;) then she went back to her house.
And the woman became with child; and she sent word to David that she was with child.
And David sent to Joab saying, Send Uriah the Hittite to me. And Joab sent Uriah to David.
And when Uriah came to him, David put questions to him about how Joab and the people were, and how the war was going.
And David said to Uriah, Go down to your house and let your feet be washed. And Uriah went away from the king's house, and an offering from the king was sent after him.
But Uriah took his rest at the door of the king's house, with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.
And when word was given to David that Uriah had not gone down to his house, David said to Uriah, Have you not come from a journey? why did you not go down to your house?
And Uriah said to David , Israel and Judah with the ark are living in tents , and my lord Joab and the other servants of my lord are sleeping in the open field ; and am I to go to my house and take food and drink , and
go to bed with my wife ? By the living Lord , and by the life of your soul , I will not do such a thing .
And David said to Uriah, Be here today, and after that I will let you go. So Uriah was in Jerusalem that day and the day after.
And when David sent for him , he took meat and drink with him , and David made him the worse for drink : and when evening came , he went to rest on his bed with the servants of his lord , but he did not go down to
his house .
Now in the morning, David gave Uriah a letter to take to Joab.
And in the letter he said, Take care to put Uriah in the very front of the line, where the fighting is most violent, and go back from him, so that he may be overcome and put to death.
So while Joab was watching the town, he put Uriah in the place where it was clear to him the best fighters were.
And the men of the town went out and had a fight with Joab: and a number of David's men came to their death in the fight, and with them Uriah the Hittite.
Then Joab sent David news of everything which had taken place in the war:
And he gave orders to the man who took the news, saying, After you have given the king all the news about the war,
If the king is angry and says, Why did you go so near the town for the fight? was it not certain that their archers would be on the wall?
Who put Abimelech , the son of Jerubbaal , to death ? did not a woman send a great stone down on him from the wall , putting him to death at Thebez ? why did you go so near the wall ? Then say to him , Your servant
Uriah the Hittite is among the dead .
So the man went , and came to David , and gave him all the news which Joab had sent him to give ; then David was angry with Joab and said , Why did you go so near the town for the fight ? was it not certain that
their archers would be on the wall ? who put Abimelech , the son of Jerubbaal , to death ? did not a woman send a great stone down on him from the wall , putting him to death at Thebez ? why did you go so near the wall
And the man said to David, Truly the men got the better of us, and came out against us into the open country, but we sent them back to the very doors of the town.
And the archers sent their arrows at your servants from the wall, and some of the king's servants are dead, and among them is your servant Uriah the Hittite.
Then David said to the man , Go and say to Joab , Do not let this be a grief to you ; for one man may come to his death by the sword like another : put up an even stronger fight against the town , and take it
: and do you put heart into him .
And when the wife of Uriah had news that her husband was dead, she gave herself up to weeping for him.
And when the days of weeping were past, David sent for her, and took her into his house, and she became his wife and gave him a son. But the Lord was not pleased with the thing David had done.
And the Lord sent Nathan to David. And Nathan came to him and said, There were two men in the same town: one a man of great wealth, and the other a poor man.
The man of wealth had great numbers of flocks and herds;
But the poor man had only one little she-lamb , which he had got and taken care of : from its birth it had been with him like one of his children ; his meat was its food , and from his cup it took its drink , resting in
his arms , and it was like a daughter to him .
Now a traveller came to the house of the man of wealth , but he would not take anything from his flock or his herd to make a meal for the traveller who had come to him , but he took the poor man ' s lamb and made it
ready for the man who had come .
And David was full of wrath against that man; and he said to Nathan, By the living Lord, death is the right punishment for the man who has done this:
And he will have to give back four times the value of the lamb, because he has done this and because he had no pity.
And Nathan said to David, You are that man. The Lord God of Israel says, I made you king over Israel, putting holy oil on you, and I kept you safe from the hands of Saul;
I gave you your master's daughter and your master's wives for yourself, and I gave you the daughters of Israel and Judah; and if that had not been enough, I would have given you such and such things.
Why then have you had no respect for the word of the Lord , doing what is evil in his eyes ? You have put Uriah the Hittite to death with the sword , and have taken his wife to be your wife ; you have put him to death
with the sword of the children of Ammon .
So now the sword will never be turned away from your family; because you have had no respect for me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.
The Lord says, From those of your family I will send evil against you, and before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to your neighbour, and he will take your wives to his bed by the light of this sun.
You did it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel and in the light of the sun.
And David said to Nathan, Great is my sin against the Lord. And Nathan said to David, The Lord has put away your sin; death will not come on you.
But still, because you have had no respect for the Lord, death will certainly overtake the child who has newly come to birth.
Then Nathan went back to his house. And the hand of the Lord was on David's son, the child of Uriah's wife, and it became very ill.
So David made prayer to God for the child; and he took no food day after day, and went in and, stretching himself out on the earth, was there all night.
And the chief men of his house got up and went to his side to make him get up from the earth, but he would not; and he would not take food with them.
And then on the seventh day the child ' s death took place . And David ' s servants were in fear of giving him the news of the child ' s death : for they said , Truly , while the child was still living he gave no attention
when we said anything to him : what will he do to himself if we give him word that the child is dead ?
But when David saw that his servants were talking together quietly, he was certain that the child was dead: and he said to his servants, Is the child dead? and they said, He is.
Then David got up from the earth , and after washing and rubbing himself with oil and changing his clothing , he went into the house of the Lord and gave worship : then he went back to his house , and at his order they put food before him
and he had a meal .
Then his servants said to him, Why have you been acting in this way? you were weeping and going without food while the child was still living; but when the child was dead, you got up and had a meal.
And he said, While the child was still living I went without food and gave myself up to weeping: for I said, Who is able to say that the Lord will not have mercy on me and give the child life?
But now that the child is dead there is no reason for me to go without food; am I able to make him come back to life? I will go to him, but he will never come back to me.
And David gave comfort to his wife Bath-sheba, and he went in to her and had connection with her: and she had a son to whom she gave the name Solomon. And he was dear to the Lord.
And he sent word by Nathan the prophet, who gave him the name Jedidiah, by the word of the Lord.
Now Joab was fighting against Rabbah, in the land of the children of Ammon, and he took the water-town.
And Joab sent men to David, saying, I have made war against Rabbah and have taken the water-town.
So now, get the rest of the people together, and put them in position against the town and take it, for if I take it, it will be named after my name.
Then David got all the people together and went to Rabbah and made war on it and took it.
And he took the crown of Milcom from his head ; the weight of it was a talent of gold , and in it were stones of great price ; and it was put on David ' s head . And he took a great store of goods from the
town .
And he took the people out of the town and put them to work with wood-cutting instruments , and iron grain-crushers , and iron axes , and at brick-making : this he did to all the towns of the children of Ammon . Then David and all the people went
back to Jerusalem .
Now after this, it came about that Absalom, David's son, had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and David's son Amnon was in love with her.
And he was so deeply in love that he became ill because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin, and so it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.
But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother: and Jonadab was a very wise man.
And he said to him, O son of the king, why are you getting thinner day by day? will you not say what your trouble is? And Amnon said to him, I am in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.
Then Jonadab said to him , Go to your bed , and let it seem that you are ill : and when your father comes to see you , say to him , Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread , and get the food ready before my
eyes , so that I may see it and take it from her hand .
So Amnon went to bed and made himself seem ill : and when the king came to see him , Amnon said to the king , Please let my sister Tamar come and make me one or two cakes before my eyes , so that I may take food from
her hand .
Then David sent to the house for Tamar and said, Go now to your brother Amnon's house and get a meal for him.
So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was in bed. And she took paste and made cakes before his eyes, cooking them over the fire.
And she took the cooking-pot, and put the cakes before him, but he would not take them. And Amnon said, Let everyone go away from me. So they all went out.
Then Amnon said to Tamar, Take the food and come into my bedroom, so that I may take it from your hand. So Tamar took the cakes she had made and went with them into her brother Amnon's bedroom.
And when she took them to give them to him, he put his arms round her and said, Come to bed, my sister.
And answering him, she said, O my brother, do not put shame on me; it is not right for such a thing to be done in Israel: do not this evil thing.
What will become of me in my shame? and as for you, you will be looked down on with disgust by all Israel. Now then, go and make your request to the king, for he will not keep me from you.
But he would not give attention to what she said: but being stronger than she, he took her by force, and had connection with her.
Then Amnon was full of hate for her, hating her with a hate greater than his earlier love for her. And he said to her, Get up and be gone.
And she said to him, Not so, my brother, for this great wrong in sending me away is worse than what you did to me before. But he gave no attention to her.
Then he gave a cry to the servant who was waiting on him and said, Put this woman out, and let the door be locked after her.
Now she had on a long robe, such as in past times the king's virgin daughters were dressed in. Then the servant put her out, locking the door after her.
And Tamar, in her grief, put dust on her head; and she put her hand on her head and went away crying loudly.
And her brother Absalom said to her , Has your brother Amnon been with you ? but now , let there be an end to your crying , my sister : he is your brother , do not take this thing to heart . So Tamar went on living uncomforted
in her brother ' s house .
But when King David had news of all these things he was very angry; but he did not make trouble for Amnon his son, for he was dear to David, being his oldest son.
But Absalom said nothing to his brother Amnon, good or bad: for he was full of hate for him, because he had taken his sister Tamar by force.
Now after two full years, Absalom had men cutting the wool of his sheep in Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim: and he sent for all the king's sons to come to his feast.
And Absalom came to the king and said, See now, your servant is cutting the wool of his sheep; will the king and his servants be pleased to come?
And the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go, or the number will be over-great for you. And he made his request again, but he would not go, but he gave him his blessing.
Then Absalom said, If you will not go, then let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Is there any reason for him to go with you?
But Absalom went on requesting him till he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him. And Absalom made a great feast like a feast for a king.
Now Absalom had given orders to his servants , saying , Now take note when Amnon ' s heart is glad with wine ; and when I say to you , Make an attack on Amnon , then put him to death without fear : have I not given you
orders ? be strong and without fear .
So Absalom's servants did to Amnon as Absalom had given them orders. Then all the king's sons got up, and every man got on his beast and went in flight.
Now while they were on their way, news was given to David that Absalom had put to death all the sons of the king and that not one of them was still living.
Then the king got up in great grief, stretching himself out on the earth: and all his servants were by his side, with their clothing parted.
And Jonadab , the son of Shimeah , David ' s brother , said , Let not my lord have the idea that all the sons of the king have been put to death ; for only Amnon is dead : this has been purposed by Absalom from the day
when he took his sister Tamar by force .
So now, let not my lord the king take this thing to heart, with the idea that all the king's sons are dead: for only Amnon is dead.
But Absalom went in flight . And the young man who kept the watch , lifting up his eyes , saw that a great band of people was coming down the slope by the way of the Horons ; and the watchman came and gave word to the king ,
saying , I saw men coming down by the way of the Horons , from the hillside .
And Jonadab said to the king, See, the king's sons are coming; as your servant said, so it is.
And while he was talking, the king's sons came, with weeping and loud cries: and the king and all his servants were weeping bitterly.
So Absalom went in flight and came to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur, where he was for three years.
And the king was sorrowing for his son all the time.
And the heart of David was wasted with desire for Absalom: for he was comforted for the death of Amnon.
Now it was clear to Joab, the son of Zeruiah, that the king's heart was turning to Absalom.
And Joab sent to Tekoa and got from there a wise woman , and said to her , Now make yourself seem like one given up to grief , and put on the clothing of sorrow , not using any sweet oil for your body , but looking like one
who for a long time has been weeping for the dead :
And come to the king and say these words to him. So Joab gave her words to say.
And the woman of Tekoa came to the king, and falling on her face, gave him honour and said, Give me help, O king.
And the king said to her, What is your trouble? And her answer was, Truly I am a widow, and my husband is dead.
And I had two sons, and the two of them had a fight in the field, and there was no one to come between them, and one with a blow put the other to death.
And now all the family is turned against me , your servant , saying , Give up him who was the cause of his brother ' s death , so that we may put him to death in payment for the life of his brother , whose life he took
; and we will put an end to the one who will get the heritage : so they will put out my last burning coal , and my husband will have no name or offspring on the face of the earth .
And the king said to the woman, Go to your house and I will give orders about this.
And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, My lord, O king, may the sin be on me and on my family, and may the king and the seat of his kingdom be clear of sin!
And the king said, If anyone says anything to you, make him come to me, and he will do you no more damage.
Then she said , Let the king keep in mind the Lord your God , so that he who gives punishment for blood may be kept back from further destruction and that no one may send death on my son . And he said , By the living Lord ,
not a hair of your son ' s head will come to the earth .
Then the woman said, Will the king let his servant say one word more? And he said, Say on.
And the woman said, Why have you had such a thought about the people of God? (for in saying these very words the king has put himself in the wrong because he has not taken back the one whom he sent far away.)
For death comes to us all , and we are like water drained out on the earth , which it is not possible to take up again ; and God will not take away the life of the man whose purpose is that he who has been sent away may
not be completely cut off from him .
And now it is my fear of the people which has made me come to say these words to my lord the king : and your servant said , I will put my cause before the king , and it may be that he will give effect to my request
For the king will give ear, and take his servant out of the power of the man whose purpose is the destruction of me and my son together from the heritage of God.
Then your servant said, May the word of my lord the king give me peace! for my lord the king is as the angel of God in his hearing of good and bad: and may the Lord your God be with you!
Then the king said to the woman, Now give me an answer to the question I am going to put to you; keep nothing back. And the woman said, Let my lord the king say on.
And the king said , Is not the hand of Joab with you in all this ? And the woman in answer said , By the life of your soul , my lord the king , it is not possible for anyone to go to the right hand or to
the left from anything said by the king : your servant Joab gave me orders , and put all these words in my mouth :
This he did, hoping that the face of this business might be changed: and my lord is wise, with the wisdom of the angel of God, having knowledge of everything on earth.
And the king said to Joab, See now, I will do this thing: go then and Come back with the young man Absalom.
Then Joab , falling down on his face on the earth , gave the king honour and blessing ; and Joab said , Today it is clear to your servant that I have grace in your eyes , my lord king , because the king has given effect to the
request of his servant .
So Joab got up and went to Geshur and came back again to Jerusalem with Absalom.
And the king said, Let him go to his house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom went back to his house and did not see the face of the king.
Now in all Israel there was no one so greatly to be praised for his beautiful form as Absalom: from his feet to the crown of his head he was completely beautiful.
And when he had his hair cut, (which he did at the end of every year, because of the weight of his hair;) the weight of the hair was two hundred shekels by the king's weight.
And Absalom was the father of three sons and of one daughter named Tamar, who was very beautiful.
For two full years Absalom was living in Jerusalem without ever seeing the face of the king.
Then Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the king, but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.
So he said to his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley in it; go and put it on fire. And Absalom's servants put the field on fire.
Then Joab came to Absalom in his house and said to him, Why have your servants put my field on fire?
And Absalom ' s answer was , See , I sent to you saying , Come here , so that I may send you to the king to say , Why have I come back from Geshur ? it would be better for me to be there still : let
me now see the king ' s face , and if there is any sin in me , let him put me to death .
So Joab went to the king and said these words to him: and when the king had sent for him, Absalom came, and went down on his face on the earth before the king: and the king gave him a kiss.
Now after this, Absalom got for himself a carriage and horses, and fifty runners to go before him.
And Absalom got up early , morning after morning , and took his place at the side of the public meeting-place : and when any man had a cause which had to come to the king to be judged , then Absalom , crying out to him , said ,
What is your town ? and he would say , Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel .
And Absalom would say to him, See, your cause is true and right; but no man has been named by the king to give you a hearing.
And more than this, Absalom said, If only I was made judge in the land, so that every man who has any cause or question might come to me, and I would give a right decision for him!
And if any man came near to give him honour, he took him by the hand and gave him a kiss.
And this Absalom did to everyone in Israel who came to the king to have his cause judged: so Absalom, like a thief, took away the hearts of the men of Israel.
Now at the end of four years, Absalom said to the king, Let me go to Hebron and give effect to the oath which I made to the Lord:
For while I was living in Geshur in Aram, your servant made an oath, saying, If ever the Lord lets me come back to Jerusalem, I will give him worship in Hebron.
And the king said to him, Go in peace. So he got up and went to Hebron.
But Absalom at the same time sent watchers through all the tribes of Israel to say, At the sound of the horn you are to say, Absalom is king in Hebron.
And with Absalom, at his request, went two hundred men from Jerusalem, who were completely unconscious of his designs.
And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, one of David's helpers, from Giloh his town, while he was making the offerings. And the design against David became strong, for more and more people were joined to Absalom.
And one came to David and said, The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom.
And David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem , Come , let us go in flight , or not one of us will be safe from Absalom : let us go without loss of time , or he will overtake us quickly and send evil
on us , and put the town to the sword .
And the king's servants said to the king, See, your servants are ready to do whatever the king says is to be done.
So the king went out, taking with him all the people of his house, but for ten of his women, who were to take care of the house.
And the king went out, and all his servants went after him, and made a stop at the Far House.
And all the people went on by his side; and all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites and all the men of Ittai of Gath, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, went on before the king.
Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, Why are you coming with us? go back and keep with the king: for you are a man of another country, you are far from the land of your birth.
It was only yesterday you came to us ; why then am I to make you go up and down with us ? for I have to go where I may ; go back then , and take your countrymen with you , and may the Lord ' s mercy
and good faith be with you .
And Ittai the Gittite in answer said, By the living Lord, and by the life of my lord the king, in whatever place my lord the king may be, for life or death, there will your servant be.
And David said to Ittai, Go forward, then. And Ittai the Gittite went on, with all his men and all the little ones he had with him.
And there was great weeping in all the country when all the people went through; and the king himself was waiting in the Kidron valley and all the people went by him in the direction of the olive-tree on the edge of the waste land.
Then Zadok came, and Abiathar, and with them the ark of God's agreement: and they put down the ark of God, till all the people from the town had gone by.
And the king said to Zadok, Take the ark of God back into the town: if I have grace in the eyes of the Lord, he will let me come back and see it and his House again:
But if he says, I have no delight in you: then, here I am; let him do to me what seems good to him.
The king said further to Zadok the priest, See, you and Abiathar are to go back to the town in peace, with your two sons, Ahimaaz, your son, and Jonathan, the son of Abiathar.
See, I will be waiting at the way across the river, in the waste land, till I get news from you.
So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and did not go away from there.
And David went up the slopes of the Mount of Olives weeping all the way, with his head covered and no shoes on his feet: and all the people who were with him, covering their heads, went up weeping.
And word came to David, saying, Ahithophel is among those who are joined to Absalom. And David said, O Lord, let the wisdom of Ahithophel be made foolish.
Now when David had come to the top of the slope, where they gave worship to God, Hushai the Archite came to him in great grief with dust on his head:
David said to him, If you go on with me, you will be a trouble to me:
But if you go back to the town and say to Absalom , I will be your servant , O king ; as in the past I have been your father ' s servant , so now I will be yours : then you will be able to keep Ahithophel
' s designs against me from being put into effect .
And have you not there Zadok and Abiathar the priests? so whatever comes to your ears from the king's house, give word of it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
See, they have with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, the son of Abiathar; by them you may send word to me of everything which comes to your ears.
So Hushai, David's friend, went into the town, and Absalom came to Jerusalem.
And when David had gone a little way past the top of the slope , Ziba , the servant of Mephibosheth , came to him , with two asses on which were two hundred cakes of bread and a hundred stems of dry grapes and a hundred summer fruits and
a skin of wine .
And David said to Ziba , What is your reason for this ? And Ziba said , The asses are for the use of the king ' s people , and the bread and the fruit are food for the young men ; and the wine is for drink for
those who are overcome by weariness in the waste land .
And the king said, And where is your master's son? And Ziba said, He is still at Jerusalem: for he said, Today Israel will give back to me the kingdom of my father.
Then the king said to Ziba, Truly everything which was Mephibosheth's is yours. And Ziba said, I give honour to my lord, may I have grace in your eyes, my lord, O king!
And when King David came to Bahurim, a man of Saul's family named Shimei, the son of Gera, came out from there, calling curses after him.
And he sent stones at David and at all the king's servants and at all the people and at all the men of war by his side, on the right hand and on the left.
And Shimei said, with curses, Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, you good-for-nothing:
The Lord has sent punishment on you for all the blood of the family of Saul , whose kingdom you have taken ; and the Lord has given the kingdom to Absalom , your son : now you yourself are taken in your evil , because you are a man
of blood .
Then Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said to the king, Is this dead dog to go on cursing my lord the king? let me go over and take off his head.
And the king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Let him go on cursing, for the Lord has said, Put a curse on David, and who then may say, Why have you done so?
And David said to Abishai and to all his servants , You see how my son , the offspring of my body , has made designs against my life : how much more then may this Benjamite do so ? Let him be , and let him go on cursing
; for the Lord has given him orders .
It may be that the Lord will take note of my wrongs, and give me back good in answer to his cursing of me today.
So David and his men went on their way: and Shimei went by the hillside parallel with them, cursing and sending stones and dust at him.
And the king and his people came tired to Jordan, and took their rest there.
And Absalom and the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him.
Then Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom and said, Long life to the king, long life to the king!
And Absalom said, Is this your love for your friend? why did you not go with your friend?
And Hushai said to Absalom, Not so; I am for that man whom the Lord and this people and all the men of Israel have taken as king, and I will take my place with him.
And more than this! where is my place as a servant? is it not before his son? as I have been your father's servant, so will I be yours.
Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give your opinion now, what are we to do?
And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father's women who are here looking after his house; then all Israel will have the news that you are hated by your father, and the hands of your supporters will be strong.
So they put up the tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father's women before the eyes of all Israel.
In those days the opinions of Ahithophel were valued as highly as if through him a man might get direction from God; so were they valued by David as much as by Absalom.
Then Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me take out twelve thousand men and this very night I will go after David:
And I will come up with him when he is tired and feeble, and make him full of fear: and all the people with him will go in flight; and I will make an attack on the king only:
And I will make all the people come back to you as a bride comes back to her husband: it is the life of only one man you are going after; so all the people will be at peace.
And the saying was pleasing to Absalom and to the responsible men of Israel.
Then Absalom said, Now send for Hushai the Archite, and let us give ear to what he has to say.
And when Hushai came, Absalom said to him, This is what Ahithophel has said: are we to do as he says? if not, what is your suggestion?
And Hushai said to Absalom, Ahithophel's idea is not a good one at this time.
Hushai said further , You have knowledge of your father and his men , that they are men of war , and that their feelings are bitter , like those of a bear in the field whose young ones have been taken from her : and your father is a
man of war , and will not take his night ' s rest with the people ;
But he will certainly have taken cover now in some hole or secret place ; and if some of our people , at the first attack , are overcome , then any hearing of it will say , There is destruction among the people who are on Absalom ' s
side .
Then even the strongest, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will become like water; for all Israel is conscious that your father is a man of war, and those who are with him are strong and without fear.
But my suggestion is that all Israel, from Dan as far as Beer-sheba, comes together to you, a great army like the sands of the sea in number; and that you yourself go out among them.
Then we will come on him in some place, wherever he may be, falling on him as the dew comes on the earth: and of him and all the men who are with him not one will get away with his life.
And if he has gone into some town, then let all Israel take strong cords to that town, and we will have it pulled into the valley, till not one small stone is to be seen there.
Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, Hushai's suggestion is better than that of Ahithophel. For it was the purpose of the Lord to make the wise designs of Ahithophel without effect, so that the Lord might send evil on Absalom.
Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, This is the suggestion made by Ahithophel to Absalom and the responsible men of Israel, and this is what I said to them.
So now send the news quickly to David , and say , Do not take your night ' s rest by the way across the river to the waste land , but be certain to go over ; or the king and all the people with him will come to
destruction .
Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting by En-rogel; and a servant-girl went from time to time and gave them news and they went with the news to King David, for it was not wise for them to let themselves be seen coming into the town.
But a boy saw them, and gave word of it to Absalom: so the two of them went away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim who had a water-hole in his garden, and they went down into it.
And a woman put a cover over the hole, and put crushed grain on top of it, and no one had any knowledge of it.
And Absalom ' s servants came to the woman at the house and said , Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan ? And the woman said to them , They have gone from here to the stream . And after searching for them , and seeing nothing of them , they
went back to Jerusalem .
Then after the servants had gone away, they came up out of the water-hole and went to give King David the news; and they said, Get up and go quickly over the water, for such and such are Ahithophel's designs against you.
So David and all the people who were with him went up over Jordan: when dawn came, every one of them had gone over Jordan.
Now when Ahithophel saw that his suggestion was not acted on , he got his ass ready , and went back to his house , to the town where he came from , and having put his house in order , he put himself to death by hanging ; so
he came to his end and was put in the resting-place of his father .
And David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom, with all the men of Israel, went over Jordan.
And Absalom put Amasa at the head of the army in place of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra the Ishmaelite, who had been the lover of Abigail, the daughter of Jesse, sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother.
And Israel and Absalom put up their tents in the land of Gilead.
Now when David had come to Mahanaim, Shobi, the son of Nahash of Rabbah, the Ammonite, and Machir, the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
Came with beds and basins and pots, and grain and meal, and all sorts of dry foods,
And honey and butter and sheep and milk-cheeses, for David and his people: for they said, This people is in the waste land, needing food and drink and rest.
And David had the people who were with him numbered, and he put over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds.
And David sent the people out , a third of them under the orders of Joab , and a third under the orders of Abishai , son of Zeruiah , Joab ' s brother , and a third under Ittai the Gittite . And the king said to the people
, And I myself will certainly go out with you .
But the people said , It is better for you not to go out : for if we are put to flight , they will not give a thought to us , and if death overtakes half of us , it will be nothing to them : but you are
of more value than ten thousand of us : so it is better for you to be ready to come to our help from this town .
And the king said to them, I will do whatever seems best to you. So the king took his place by the door of the town, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.
And the king gave orders to Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Because of me, be gentle to the young man Absalom. And this order about Absalom was given in the hearing of all the people.
So the people went out into the field against Israel, and the fight took place in the woods of Ephraim.
And the people of Israel were overcome there by the servants of David, and there was a great destruction that day, and twenty thousand men were put to the sword.
And the fighting went on over all the face of the country: and the woods were responsible for more deaths than the sword.
And Absalom came across some of David ' s men . And Absalom was seated on his mule , and the mule went under the thick branches of a great tree , and his head became fixed in the tree and he was lifted up between earth and heaven ,
and the beast under him went on .
And a certain man saw it and said to Joab, I saw Absalom hanging in a tree.
And Joab said to the man who had given him the news, If you saw this, why did you not put your sword through him, and I would have given you ten bits of silver and a band for your robe?
And the man said to Joab , Even if you gave me a thousand bits of silver , I would not put out my hand against the king ' s son : for in our hearing the king gave orders to you and Abishai and Ittai , saying , Take
care that the young man Absalom is not touched .
And if I had falsely put him to death (and nothing may be kept secret from the king), you would have had nothing to do with me.
Then Joab said, I would have made it safe for you. And he took three spears in his hand, and put them through Absalom's heart, while he was still living, in the branches of the tree.
And ten young men, servants of Joab, came round Absalom and put an end to him.
And Joab had the horn sounded, and the people came back from going after Israel, for Joab kept them back.
And they took Absalom's body and put it into a great hole in the wood, and put a great mass of stones over it: and every man of Israel went in flight to his tent.
Now Absalom , before his death , had put up for himself a pillar in the king ' s valley , naming it after himself ; for he said , I have no son to keep my name in memory : and to this day it is named Absalom '
s pillar .
Then Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, said, Let me go and give the king news of how the Lord has done right in his cause against those who took up arms against him.
And Joab said, You will take no news today; another day you may give him the news, but you will take no news today, because the king's son is dead.
Then Joab said to the Cushite, Go and give the king word of what you have seen. And the Cushite, making a sign of respect to Joab, went off running.
Then Ahimaaz , the son of Zadok , said to Joab again , Whatever may come of it , let me go after the Cushite . And Joab said , Why have you a desire to go , my son , seeing that you will get no reward for your
news ?
Whatever may come of it, he said, I will go. Then he said to him, Go. So Ahimaaz went running by the lowland road and overtook the Cushite.
Now David was seated between the two town doors; and the watchman went up to the roof of the doorways, on the wall, and, lifting up his eyes, saw a man running by himself.
And the watchman gave news of it to the king. And the king said, If he is coming by himself, then he has news. And the man was travelling quickly, and came near.
Then the watchman saw another man running: and crying out in the direction of the door he said, Here is another man running by himself. And the king said, He, like the other, comes with news.
And the watchman said, It seems to me that the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and his news will be good.
And Ahimaaz , crying out to the king , said , It is well . And falling down before the king , with his face to the earth , he said , May the Lord your God be praised , who has given up the men who took up arms
against my lord the king !
And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz said in answer, When Joab sent me, your servant, I saw a great outcry going on, but I had no knowledge of what it was.
And the king said, Get back and take your place here. So turning to one side, he took his place there.
And then the Cushite came and said, I have news for my lord the king: today the Lord has done right in your cause against all those who took up arms against you.
And the king said to the Cushite, Is the young man Absalom safe? And the Cushite said in answer, May all the king's haters and those who do evil against the king, be as that young man is!
Then the king was much moved , and went up into the room over the door , weeping , and saying , O my son Absalom , my son , my son Absalom ! if only my life might have been given for yours , O Absalom , my son
, my son !
And word was given to Joab that the king was weeping and sorrowing for Absalom.
And the salvation of that day was changed to sorrow for all the people: for it was said to the people, The king is in bitter grief for his son.
And the people made their way back to the town quietly and secretly, as those who are shamed go secretly when they go in flight from the war.
But the king, covering his face, gave a great cry, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!
And Joab came into the house to the king and said, Today you have put to shame the faces of all your servants who even now have kept you and your sons and your daughters and your wives and all your women safe from death;
For your haters , it seems , are dear to you , and your friends are hated . For you have made it clear that captains and servants are nothing to you : and now I see that if Absalom was living and we had all been dead today ,
it would have been right in your eyes .
So get up now , and go out and say some kind words to your servants ; for , by the Lord , I give you my oath , that if you do not go out , not one of them will keep with you tonight ; and that will
be worse for you than all the evil which has overtaken you from your earliest years .
Then the king got up and took his seat near the town-door . And word was given to all the people that the king was in the public place : and all the people came before the king . Now all the men of Israel had gone back in flight
to their tents .
And through all the tribes of Israel the people were having arguments , saying , The king made us safe from the hands of those who were against us and made us free from the hands of the Philistines ; and now he has gone in flight from the land
, because of Absalom .
And Absalom, whom we made a ruler over us, is dead in the fight. So now why do you say nothing about getting the king back? And word of what all Israel was saying came to the king.
And King David sent word to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, Say to the responsible men of Judah, Why are you the last to take steps to get the king back to his house?
You are my brothers, my bone and my flesh; why are you the last to get the king back again?
And say to Amasa, Are you not my bone and my flesh? May God's punishment be on me, if I do not make you chief of the army before me at all times in place of Joab!
And the hearts of the men of Judah were moved like one man; so that they sent to the king, saying, Come back, with all your servants.
So the king came back, and came as far as Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, meeting the king there, to take him back with them over Jordan.
And Shimei, the son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, got up quickly and went down with the men of Judah for the purpose of meeting King David;
And with him a thousand men of Benjamin, and Ziba, the servant of Saul, with his fifteen sons and twenty servants, came rushing to Jordan before the king,
And kept going across the river to take the people of the king ' s house over , and to do whatever was desired by the king . And Shimei , the son of Gera , went down on his face in the dust before the king , when he
was about to go over Jordan ,
And said to him, Let me not be judged as a sinner in your eyes, O my lord, and do not keep in mind the wrong I did on the day when my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, or take it to heart.
For your servant is conscious of his sin: and so, as you see, I have come today, the first of all the sons of Joseph, for the purpose of meeting my lord the king.
But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said, Is not death the right fate for Shimei, because he has been cursing the one marked by the holy oil?
And David said , What have I to do with you , you sons of Zeruiah , that you put yourselves against me today ? is it right for any man in Israel to be put to death today ? for I am certain today that I am king in
Israel .
So the king said to Shimei, You will not be put to death. And the king gave him his oath.
And Mephibosheth , the son of Saul ' s son , came down for the purpose of meeting the king ; his feet had not been cared for or his hair cut or his clothing washed from the day when the king went away till the day when he came
back in peace .
Now when he had come from Jerusalem to see the king, the king said to him, Why did you not come with me, Mephibosheth?
And he said in answer , Because of the deceit of my servant , my lord king : for I , your servant , said to him , You are to make ready an ass and on it I will go with the king , for your servant has not
the use of his feet .
He has given you a false account of me: but my lord the king is like the angel of God: do then whatever seems good to you.
For all my father's family were only dead men before my lord the king: and still you put your servant among those whose place is at the king's table. What right then have I to say anything more to the king?
And the king said, Say nothing more about these things. I say, Let there be a division of the land between Ziba and you.
And Mephibosheth said, Let him take it all, now that my lord the king has come back to his house in peace!
And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went on as far as Jordan with the king to take him across Jordan.
Now Barzillai was a very old man, as much as eighty years old: and he had given the king everything he had need of, while he was at Mahanaim, for he was a very great man.
And the king said to Barzillai, Come over with me, and I will take care of you in Jerusalem.
And Barzillai said to the king, How much of my life is still before me, for me to go up to Jerusalem with the king?
I am now eighty years old : good and bad are the same to me ; have meat and drink any taste for me now ? am I able to take pleasure in the voices of men or women in song ? why then am I to be a trouble
to my lord the king ?
Your servant's desire was only to take the king over Jordan; why is the king to give me such a reward?
Let your servant now go back again , so that when death comes to me , it may be in my town and by the resting-place of my father and mother . But here is your servant Chimham : let him go with my lord the king , and do
for him what seems good to you .
And the king said in answer, Let Chimham go over with me, and I will do for him whatever seems good to you: and whatever your desire is, I will do it for you.
Then all the people went over Jordan, and the king went over: and the king gave Barzillai a kiss, with his blessing; and he went back to his place.
So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went with him: and all the people of Judah, as well as half the people of Israel, took the king on his way.
Then the men of Israel came to the king and said, Why have our countrymen of Judah taken you away in secret and come over Jordan with the king and all his family, because all his people are David's men?
And all the men of Judah gave this answer to the men of Israel, Because the king is our near relation: why then are you angry about this? have we taken any of the king's food, or has he given us any offering?
And in answer to the men of Judah , the men of Israel said , We have ten parts in the king , and we are the first in order of birth : why did you make nothing of us ? and were we not the first to make suggestions
for getting the king back ? And the words of the men of Judah were more violent than the words of the men of Israel .
Now after this , David , questioning the Lord , said , Am I to go up into any of the towns of Judah ? And the Lord said to him , Go up . And David said , Where am I to go ? And he said , To
Hebron .
So David went there, taking with him his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail, the wife of Nabal of Carmel.
And David took all his men with him, every man with his family: and they were living in the towns round Hebron.
And the men of Judah came there, and with the holy oil made David king over the people of Judah. And word came to David that it was the men of Jabesh-gilead who put Saul's body in its last resting-place.
And David sent to the men of Jabesh-gilead and said to them, May the Lord give you his blessing, because you have done this kind act to Saul your lord, and have put his body to rest!
May the Lord be good and true to you: and I myself will see that your kind act is rewarded, because you have done this thing.
Then let your hands be strong, and have no fear: though Saul your lord is dead, the people of Judah have made me their king.
Now Abner, the son of Ner, captain of Saul's army, had taken Saul's son Ish-bosheth over to Mahanaim,
And made him king over Gilead and the Asherites and over Jezreel and Ephraim and Benjamin, that is, over all Israel.
(Saul's son Ish-bosheth was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he was ruler for two years.) But Judah was on the side of David.
And the time when David was king in Hebron over the people of Judah was seven years and six months.
And Abner, the son of Ner, with the servants of Saul's son Ish-bosheth, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out and came face to face with them by the pool of Gibeon; and they took up their position, facing one another on opposite sides of the pool.
And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men give a test of their strength before us. And Joab said, Let them do so.
So they got up and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth and twelve of the servants of David.
And every one got the other by the head, driving his sword into the other's side, so they all went down together: and that place was named the Field of Sides, and it is in Gibeon.
And there was hard fighting that day; and Abner and the men of Israel gave way before the servants of David.
There were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab and Abishai and Asahel: and Asahel was as quick-footed as a roe of the fields.
Asahel went running after Abner, not turning to the right or to the left.
Then Abner, looking back, said, Is it you, Asahel? And he said, It is I.
And Abner said, Then go to the right or to the left and put your hands on one of the fighting-men and take his arms. But Asahel would not be turned away from going after Abner.
Then again Abner said to Asahel, Go to one side, do not keep on coming after me: why will you make me put an end to you? for then I will be shamed before your brother Joab.
But still he did not go to one side : so Abner gave him a back blow in the stomach with his spear , so that the spear came out at his back ; and he went down on the earth , wounded to death : and all those who
came to the place where Asahel went down dead , came to a stop .
But Joab and Abishai went after Abner: and the sun went down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which is to the east of the road through the waste land of Geba.
And the men of Benjamin came together after Abner in one band, and took their places on the top of a hill.
Then crying out to Joab , Abner said , Are fighting and destruction to go on for ever ? do you not see that the end will only be bitter ? how long will it be before you send the people back and make them give up attacking their countrymen
And Joab said, By the living God, if you had not given the word, the people would have gone on attacking their countrymen till the morning.
So Joab had a horn sounded, and all the people came to a stop, and gave up going after Israel and fighting them.
And all that night Abner and his men went through the Arabah; they went over Jordan and through all Bithron and came to Mahanaim.
And Joab came back from fighting Abner: and when he had got all his men together, it was seen that nineteen of David's men, in addition to Asahel, were not with them.
But David's men had put to death three hundred and sixty of the men of Benjamin and of Abner's men
And they took Asahel's body and put it in the last resting-place of his father in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men, travelling all night, came to Hebron at dawn.
Now by chance there was present a good-for-nothing person named Sheba , the son of Bichri , a Benjamite : and he , sounding the horn , said , We have no part in David , or any interest in the son of Jesse : let every man go to
his tent , O Israel .
So all the men of Israel, turning away from David, went after Sheba, the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah were true to their king, going with him from Jordan as far as Jerusalem.
And David came to his house at Jerusalem : and the king took the ten women to whom he had given the care of the house , and had them shut up , and gave them the necessaries of life , but did not go near them . So they
were shut up till the day of their death , living as widows .
Then the king said to Amasa, Get all the men of Judah together, and in three days be here yourself.
So Amasa went to get all the men of Judah together, but he took longer than the time David had given him.
And David said to Abishai , Sheba , the son of Bichri , will do us more damage than Absalom did ; so take some of your lord ' s servants and go after him , before he makes himself safe in the walled towns , and gets away before
our eyes .
So there went after Abishai, Joab and the Cherethites and the Pelethites and all the fighting-men; they went out of Jerusalem to overtake Sheba, the son of Bichri.
When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon , Amasa came face to face with them . Now Joab had on his war-dress , and round him a band from which his sword was hanging in its cover ; and while he was walking , it came
out , falling to the earth .
And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well, my brother? And with his right hand he took him by the hair of his chin to give him a kiss.
But Amasa did not see danger from the sword which was now in Joab ' s left hand , and Joab put it through his stomach so that his inside came out on to the earth , and he did not give him another blow . So Joab and his
brother Abishai went on after Sheba , the son of Bichri .
And one of Joab's young men, taking his place at Amasa's side, said, Whoever is for Joab and for David, let him go after Joab!
And Amasa was stretched out in a pool of blood in the middle of the highway . And when the man saw that all the people were stopping , he took Amasa out of the highway and put him in a field , with a cloth over him , when
he saw that everyone who went by came to a stop .
When he had been taken off the road, all the people went on after Joab in search of Sheba, the son of Bichri.
And Sheba went through all the tribes of Israel, to Abel of Beth-maacah; and all the Bichrites came together and went in after him.
And Joab and his men got him shut up in Abel of Beth-maacah, and put up an earthwork against the town: and all Joab's men did their best to get the wall broken down.
Then a wise woman got up on the wall, and crying out from the town, said, Give ear, give ear; say now to Joab, Come near, so that I may have talk with you.
And he came near, and the woman said, Are you Joab? And he said in answer, I am. Then she said, Give ear to your servant's words. And he said, I am giving ear.
Then she said, In the old days, there was a saying, Let them put the question in Abel and in Dan, saying, Has what was ordered by men of good faith in Israel ever come to an end?
Your purpose is the destruction of a mother-town in Israel: why would you put an end to the heritage of the Lord?
And Joab, answering her, said, Far, far be it from me to be a cause of death or destruction;
Not so : but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim , Sheba , son of Bichri , by name , has taken up arms against the king , against David : give up this man only , and I will go away from the town . And the woman
said to Joab , His head will be dropped over the wall to you .
Then the woman in her wisdom had talk with all the town . And they had Sheba ' s head cut off and sent out to Joab . And he had the horn sounded , and sent them all away from the town , every man to his tent .
And Joab went back to Jerusalem to the king .
Now Joab was over all the army; and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was at the head of the Cherethites and the Pelethites;
And Adoram was overseer of the forced work; and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the recorder;
And Sheva was the scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
And in addition, Ira the Jairite was a priest to David.
In the days of David they were short of food for three years, year after year; and David went before the Lord for directions. And the Lord said, On Saul and on his family there is blood, because he put the Gibeonites to death.
Then the king sent for the Gibeonites ; ( now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel , but were the last of the Amorites , to whom the children of Israel had given an oath ; but Saul , in his passion for the children of Israel
and Judah , had made an attempt on their lives : )
So David said to the Gibeonites, What may I do for you? how am I to make up to you for your wrongs, so that you may give a blessing to the heritage of the Lord?
And the Gibeonites said to him , It is not a question of silver and gold between us and Saul or his family ; and it is not in our power to put to death any man in Israel . And he said , Say , then , what am
I to do for you ?
And they said to the king, As for the man by whom we were wasted, and who made designs against us to have us completely cut off from the land of Israel,
Let seven men of his family be given up to us and we will put an end to them by hanging them before the Lord in Gibeon, on the hill of the Lord. And the king said, I will give them.
But the king did not give up Mephibosheth, the son of Saul's son Jonathan, because of the Lord's oath made between David and Jonathan, the son of Saul.
But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Saul to whom Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, had given birth; and the five sons of Saul's daughter Merab, whose father was Adriel, the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
And he gave them up to the Gibeonites, and they put them to death, hanging them on the mountain before the Lord; all seven came to their end together in the first days of the grain-cutting, at the start of the cutting of the barley.
And Rizpah , the daughter of Aiah , took haircloth , placing it on the rock as a bed for herself , from the start of the grain-cutting till rain came down on them from heaven ; and she did not let the birds of the air come near them
by day , or the beasts of the field by night .
And news was given to David of what Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, one of Saul's wives, had done.
And David went and took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-gilead , who had taken them away secretly from the public place of Beth-shan , where the Philistines had put them , hanging up the bodies there on the day when they put
Saul to death in Gilboa :
And he took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from that place; and they got together the bones of those who had been put to death by hanging.
And they put them with the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the resting-place of Kish , his father , in Zela in the country of Benjamin ; they did all the king had given them orders to do . And after that , God gave ear to
their prayers for the land .
And the Philistines went to war again with Israel; and David went down with his people, and while they were at Gob they had a fight with the Philistines:
And there came against David one of the offspring of the Rephaim, whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, and having a new sword, he made an attempt to put David to death.
But Abishai , the son of Zeruiah , came to his help , and , turning on the Philistine , gave him his death-blow . Then David ' s men took an oath , and said , Never again are you to go out with us to the fight ,
so that you may not put out the light of Israel .
Now after this there was war with the Philistines again at Gob, and Sibbecai the Hushathite put to death Saph, one of the offspring of the Rephaim.
And again there was war with the Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan, the son of Jair the Beth-lehemite, put to death Goliath the Gittite, the stem of whose spear was like a cloth-worker's rod.
And again there was war at Gath, where there was a very tall man, who had twenty-four fingers and toes, six fingers on his hands and six toes on his feet; he was one of the offspring of the Rephaim.
And when he was purposing to put shame on Israel, Jonathan, the son of Shimei, David's brother, put him to death.
These four were of the offspring of the Rephaim in Gath; and they came to their end by the hands of David and his servants.
And David made a song to the Lord in these words, on the day when the Lord made him free from the hands of all his haters, and from the hand of Saul:
And he said, The Lord is my Rock, my walled town, and my saviour, even mine;
My God, my Rock, in him will I put my faith; my breastplate, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my safe place; my saviour, who keeps me safe from the violent man.
I will send up my cry to the Lord, who is to be praised; so will I be made safe from those who are against me.
For the waves of death came round me, and the seas of evil put me in fear;
The cords of hell were round me: the nets of death came on me.
In my trouble my voice went up to the Lord, and my cry to my God: my voice came to his hearing in his holy Temple, and my prayer came to his ears.
Then the earth was moved with a violent shock; the bases of heaven were moved and shaking, because he was angry.
There went up a smoke from his nose, and a fire of destruction from his mouth: coals were lighted by it.
The heavens were bent, so that he might come down; and it was dark under his feet.
And he went through the air, seated on a storm-cloud: going quickly on the wings of the wind.
And he made the dark his tent round him, a mass of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
Before his shining light his dark clouds went past, raining ice and coals of fire.
The Lord made thunder in the heavens, and the voice of the Highest was sounding out.
And he sent out his arrows, driving them in all directions; by his flames of fire they were troubled.
Then the deep beds of the sea were seen, and the bases of the world were uncovered, because of the Lord's wrath, because of the breath of his mouth.
He sent from on high, he took me, pulling me out of great waters.
He made me free from my strong hater, from those who were against me, because they were stronger than I.
They came on me in the day of my trouble: but the Lord was my support.
He took me out into a wide place; he was my saviour because he had delight in me.
The Lord gives me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean before him.
For I have kept the ways of the Lord; I have not been turned away in sin from my God.
For all his decisions were before me, and I did not put away his laws from me.
And I was upright before him, and I kept myself from sin.
Because of this the Lord has given me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean in his eyes.
On him who has mercy you will have mercy; to the upright you will be upright;
He who is holy will see that you are holy; but to the man whose way is not straight you will be a hard judge.
For you are the saviour of those who are in trouble; but your eyes are on men of pride, to make them low.
For you are my light, O Lord; and the Lord will make the dark bright for me.
By your help I have made a way through the wall which was shutting me in: by the help of my God I have gone over a wall.
As for God, his way is all good: the word of the Lord is tested; he is a safe cover for all those who put their faith in him.
For who is God but the Lord? and who is a Rock but our God?
God puts a strong band about me, guiding me in a straight way.
He makes my feet like roes' feet, and puts me on high places.
He makes my hands expert in war, so that a bow of brass is bent by my arms.
You have given me the breastplate of your salvation, and your mercy has made me great.
You have made my steps wide under me, so that my feet make no slip.
I go after my haters and overtake them; not turning back till they are all overcome.
I have sent destruction on them and given them wounds, so that they are not able to get up: they are stretched under my feet.
For I have been armed by you with strength for the fight: you have made low under me those who came out against me.
By you their backs are turned in flight, so that my haters are cut off.
They were crying out, but there was no one to come to their help: even to the Lord, but he gave them no answer.
Then they were crushed as small as the dust of the earth, stamped down under my feet like the waste of the streets.
You have made me free from the fightings of my people; you have made me the head of the nations: a people of whom I had no knowledge will be my servants.
Men of other countries will, with false hearts, put themselves under my authority: from the time when my name comes to their ears, they will be ruled by me.
They will be wasted away, they will come out of their secret places shaking with fear.
The Lord is living; praise be to my Rock, and let the God of my salvation be honoured:
It is God who sends punishment on my haters, and puts peoples under my rule.
He makes me free from my haters: I am lifted up over those who come up against me: you have made me free from the violent man.
Because of this I will give you praise, O Lord, among the nations, and will make a song of praise to your name.
Great salvation does he give to his king; he has mercy on the king of his selection, David, and on his seed for ever.
Now these are the last words of David . David , the son of Jesse , says , the man who was lifted up on high , the man on whom the God of Jacob put the holy oil , the loved one of Israel ' s songs , says
The spirit of the Lord had voice through me, his word was on my tongue.
The God of Israel said, the word of the Rock of Israel came to me: When an upright king is ruling over men, when he is ruling in the fear of God,
It is as the light of the morning, when the sun comes up, a morning without clouds; making young grass come to life from the earth.
For is not my house so with God? For he has made with me an eternal agreement, ordered in all things and certain: as for all my salvation and all my desire, will he not give it increase?
But the evil-doers, all of them, will be like thorns to be pushed away, because they may not be gripped in the hand:
But anyone touching them has to be armed with iron and the rod of a spear; and they will be burned with fire, every one of them.
These are the names of David's men of war: Ishbaal the Hachmonite, chief of the three; his axe was lifted up against eight hundred put to death at one time.
After him was Eleazar, the son of Dodai the Ahohite, one of the three great fighters, who was with David in Pas-dammim when the Philistines came together there for the fight; and when the men of Israel had gone in flight,
He was with David and went on fighting the Philistines till his hand became tired and stiff from gripping his sword: and that day the Lord gave a great salvation, and the people came back after him only to take the goods of the Philistines.
After him was Shammah, the son of Ela the Hararite. And the Philistines came together in Lehi, where there was a bit of land full of seed; and the people went in flight from the Philistines.
But he kept his place in the middle of the bit of land, and kept back their attack and overcame the Philistines: and the Lord gave a great salvation.
And three of the thirty went down at the start of the grain-cutting, and they came to David at the strong place of Adullam; and the band of Philistines had taken up their position in the valley of Rephaim.
And at that time David had taken cover in the strong place, and an armed force of the Philistines was in Beth-lehem.
And David, moved by a strong desire, said, If only someone would give me a drink of water from the water-hole of Beth-lehem, by the doorway into the town!
And the three men , forcing their way through the Philistine army , got water from the water-hole of Beth-lehem , by the doorway into the town , and took it back to David : but he would not take it , but , draining it out , made an
offering of it to the Lord .
And he said , Far be it from me , O Lord , to do this ; how may I take as my drink the life-blood of men who have put their lives in danger ? So he would not take it . These things did the three great men
of war .
And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the thirty. He put to death three hundred with his spear, and he got for himself a name among the thirty.
Was he not the noblest of the thirty? so he was made their captain: but he was not equal to the first three.
And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, a fighting man of Kabzeel, had done great acts; he put to death the two sons of Ariel of Moab: he went down into a hole and put a lion to death in time of snow:
And he made an attack on an Egyptian , a tall man : and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand ; but he went down to him with a stick , and pulling the spear out of the hands of the Egyptian , put him to death with
that same spear .
These were the acts of Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, who had a great name among the thirty men of war.
He was honoured over the rest of the thirty, but he was not equal to the first three. And David put him over the fighting men who kept him safe.
Asahel, the brother of Joab, was one of the thirty; and Elhanan, the son of Dodai, of Beth-lehem,
Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
Helez the Paltite, Ira, the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
Abiezer the Anathothite, Sibbecai the Hushathite,
Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
Heldai, the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai, the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,
Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the valleys of Gaash,
Abiel the Arbathite, Azmaveth of Bahurim,
Eliahba the Shaalbonite, Jashen the Gunite,
Jonathan, the son of Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam, the son of Sharar the Hararite,
Eliphelet, the son of Ahasbai the Maacathite, Eliam, the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Archite,
Igal, the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, who had the care of the arms of Joab, son of Zeruiah,
Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in number.
Again the wrath of the Lord was burning against Israel, and moving David against them, he said, Go, take the number of Israel and Judah.
And the king said to Joab and the captains of the army , who were with him , Go now through all the tribes of Israel , from Dan as far as Beer-sheba , and have all the people numbered , so that I may be certain of the number
of the people .
And Joab said to the king , Whatever the number of the people , may the Lord make it a hundred times as much , and may the eyes of my lord the king see it : but why does my lord the king take pleasure in doing this thing
But the king's order was stronger than Joab and the captains of the army. And Joab and the captains of the army went out from the king, to take the number of the children of Israel.
And they went over Jordan, and starting from Aroer, from the town which is in the middle of the valley, they went in the direction of the Gadites, and on to Jazer;
Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of the Hittites under Hermon; and they came to Dan, and from Dan they came round to Zidon,
And to the walled town of Tyre, and to all the towns of the Hivites and the Canaanites: and they went out to the South of Judah at Beer-sheba.
So after going through all the land in every direction, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
And Joab gave the king the number of all the people: there were in Israel eight hundred thousand fighting men able to take up arms; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand.
And after the people had been numbered , David ' s heart was troubled . And David said to the Lord , Great has been my sin in doing this ; but now , O Lord , be pleased to take away the sin of your servant , for I
have done very foolishly
And David got up in the morning; now the word of the Lord had come to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
Go and say to David, The Lord says, Three things are offered to you: say which of them you will have, and I will do it to you.
So Gad came to David , and gave him word of this and said to him , Are there to be three years when there is not enough food in your land ? or will you go in flight from your haters for three months , while they go after
you ? or will you have three days of violent disease in your land ? take thought and say what answer I am to give to him who sent me .
And David said to Gad, This is a hard decision for me to make: let us come into the hands of the Lord, for great are his mercies: let me not come into the hands of men.
So David made selection of the disease; and the time was the days of the grain-cutting, when the disease came among the people, causing the death of seventy thousand men from Dan as far as Beer-sheba.
And when the hand of the angel was stretched out in the direction of Jerusalem , for its destruction , the Lord had regret for the evil , and said to the angel who was sending destruction on the people , It is enough ; do no more . And
the angel of the Lord was by the grain-floor of Araunah the Jebusite .
And when David saw the angel who was causing the destruction of the people , he said to the Lord , Truly , the sin is mine ; I have done wrong : but these are only sheep ; what have they done ? let your hand be against me
and against my family .
And that day Gad came to David and said to him, Go up, and put up an altar to the Lord on the grain-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
So David went up, as Gad had said and as the Lord had given orders.
And Araunah, looking out, saw the king and his servants coming to him: and Araunah went out, and went down on his face to the earth before the king.
And Araunah said, Why has my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To give you a price for your grain-floor, so that I may put up an altar to the Lord, and the disease may be stopped among the people.
And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take whatever seems right to him, and make an offering of it: see, here are the oxen for the burned offering, and the grain-cleaning instruments and the ox-yokes for wood:
All this does the servant of my lord the king give to the king. And Araunah said, May the Lord your God be pleased with your offering!
And the king said to Araunah , No , but I will give you a price for it ; I will not give to the Lord my God burned offerings for which I have given nothing . So David got the grain-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver
And there David put up an altar to the Lord, making burned offerings and peace-offerings. So the Lord gave ear to his prayer for the land, and the disease came to an end in Israel.
Now there was a long war between Saul's people and David's people; and David became stronger and stronger, but those on Saul's side became more and more feeble.
While David was in Hebron he became the father of sons: the oldest was Amnon, son of Ahinoam of Jezreel;
And the second, Chileab, whose mother was Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom, son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur;
And the fourth, Adonijah, the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah, the son of Abital;
And the sixth, Ithream, whose mother was David's wife Eglah. These were the sons of David, whose birth took place in Hebron.
Now while there was war between Saul's people and David's people, Abner was making himself strong among the supporters of Saul.
Now Saul had among his wives a woman named Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, Why have you taken my father's wife?
And Abner was very angry at the words of Ish-bosheth , and he said , Am I a dog ' s head of Judah ? I am this day doing all in my power for the cause of your father Saul and for his brothers and his friends , and
have not given you up into the hands of David , and now you say I have done wrong with a woman .
May God's punishment be on Abner, if I do not for David as the Lord in his oath has said,
And if I do not take away the kingdom from the family of Saul and make David ruler over Israel and Judah from Dan as far as Beer-sheba!
And so great was Ish-bosheth's fear of Abner that he was not able to say a word in answer.
And Abner sent men to David at Hebron, saying, Make an agreement with me, and I will give you my support in getting all Israel on your side.
And he said , It is well ; I will make an agreement with you , but on one condition , which is , that when you come before me , Saul ' s daughter Michal is to come with you ; till she comes you will not see my
face .
And David sent men to Saul's son Ish-bosheth, saying, Give me back Michal, my wife, whom I made mine for the price of the private parts of a hundred Philistines.
So Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband Paltiel, the son of Laish.
And her husband went with her as far as Bahurim, weeping while he went. Then Abner said to him, Go back. And he went back.
Then Abner had a talk with the chief men of Israel, saying, In the past it was your desire to make David your king: so now, do it:
For the Lord has said of David, By the hand of my servant David I will make my people Israel safe from the Philistines, and from all who are against them.
And Abner said the same things to Benjamin: and he went to David in Hebron to make clear to him what seemed good to Israel and to all the people of Benjamin.
So Abner, with twenty men, came to Hebron, to David. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.
And Abner said to David , Now I will go , and make all Israel come to my lord the king , so that they may make an agreement with you , and your kingdom may be as wide as your heart ' s desire . Then David sent Abner
away and he went in peace .
Now the servants of David and Joab had been out attacking a band of armed men , and they came back with a great store of goods taken in the fight : but Abner was no longer in Hebron with David , for he had sent him away and he
had gone in peace .
When Joab and his men came, news was given them that Abner, the son of Ner, had come to the king, who had let him go away again in peace.
Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have you done? when Abner came to you why did you send him away and let him go?
Is it not clear to you that Abner, the son of Ner, came with deceit to get knowledge of your going out and your coming in and of all you are doing?
And when Joab had come out from David, he sent men after Abner, and they overtook him at the water-spring of Sirah, and made him come back with them: but David had no knowledge of it.
And when Abner was back in Hebron , Joab took him on one side by the doorway of the town to have a word with him quietly , and there he gave him a wound in the stomach , causing his death in payment for the death of his brother
Asahel .
And when David had word of it he said, May I and my kingdom be clear for ever in the eyes of the Lord from the blood of Abner, the son of Ner:
May it come on the head of Joab and all his father ' s family : among the men of Joab ' s family may there ever be some who are diseased or lepers , or who do the work of women , or are put to the sword ,
or are wasted from need of food !
So Joab and Abishai his brother put Abner to death, because he had put to death their brother Asahel in the fight at Gibeon.
And David said to Joab and all the people who were with him, Go in grief and put haircloth about you, in sorrow for Abner. And King David went after the dead body.
And they put Abner's body to rest in Hebron; and the king and all the people were weeping loudly by the resting-place of Abner's body.
And the king made a song of grief for Abner and said, Was the death of Abner to be like the death of a foolish man?
Your hands were free, your feet were not chained: like the downfall of a man before evil men, so was your fall. And the weeping of the people over him went on again.
And the people came to make David take food, while it was still day, but David with an oath said, May God's punishment be on me if I take a taste of bread or any other thing till the sun has gone down!
And all the people took note of it and were pleased: like everything the king did, it was pleasing to the people.
So it was clear to Israel and to all the people on that day that the king was not responsible for the death of Abner, the son of Ner.
And the king said to his servants, Do you not see that a chief and a great man has come to his end today in Israel?
While I, though I am crowned king, have little strength, and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are out of my control: may the Lord give to the evil-doer the reward of his evil-doing!
And when Saul's son Ish-bosheth had news that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
And Saul's son had two men, captains of bands, one named Baanah and the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the tribe of Benjamin; (for Beeroth was at one time taken to be part of Benjamin:
But the people of Beeroth had gone in flight to Gittaim, where they have been living to this day.)
Now Jonathan , Saul ' s son , had a son whose feet were damaged . He was five years old when news of the death of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel , and the woman who took care of him took him up and went in flight :
and while she was getting him away as quickly as she was able , he had a fall and his feet were damaged . His name was Mephibosheth .
And Rechab and Baanah , the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , went out and came to the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day , when he was resting in the middle of the day . Now the woman who kept the door was cleaning grain ,
and sleep overcame her .
And Rechab and his brother Baanah got in without being seen.
And when they came into the house , Ish-bosheth was stretched on his bed in his bedroom ; and they made an attack on him and put him to death , and , cutting off his head , they took it with them and went by the road through the
Arabah all night .
And they took the head of Ish-bosheth to David in Hebron , and said to the king , Here is the head of Ish-bosheth , the son of Saul your hater , who would have taken your life ; the Lord has taken payment for the wrongs of my lord
the king from Saul and his seed today .
And David made answer to Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, By the living Lord, who has kept me safe from all my trouble,
When one came to me with the news of Saul's death, in the belief that it would be good news, I took him and put him to death in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news:
How much more, when evil men have put an upright person to death, in his house, sleeping on his bed, will I take payment from you for his blood, and have you cut off from the earth?
And David gave orders to his young men and they put them to death , cutting off their hands and their feet and hanging them up by the side of the pool in Hebron . But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and put it in its last resting-place with
Abner ' s body in Hebron .
Then all the tribes of Israel came to David in Hebron and said, Truly, we are your bone and your flesh.
In the past when Saul was king over us, it was you who went at the head of Israel when they went out or came in: and the Lord said to you, You are to be the keeper of my people Israel and their ruler.
So all the responsible men of Israel came to the king at Hebron; and King David made an agreement with them in Hebron before the Lord: and they put the holy oil on David and made him king over Israel.
David was thirty years old when he became king, and he was king for forty years,
Ruling over Judah in Hebron for seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem, over all Israel and Judah, for thirty-three years.
And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites , the people of the land : and they said to David , You will not come in here , but the blind and the feeble-footed will keep you out ; for they said , David will not
be able to come in here .
But David took the strong place of Zion, which is the town of David.
And that day David said , Whoever makes an attack on the Jebusites , let him go up by the water-pipe , and put to death all the blind and feeble-footed who are hated by David . And this is why they say , The blind and feeble-footed may not
come into the house .
So David took the strong tower for his living-place, naming it the town of David. And David took in hand the building of the town all round, starting from the Millo.
And David became greater and greater; for the Lord, the God of armies, was with him.
And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent men to David, with cedar-trees and woodworkers and stoneworkers: and they made David a house.
And David saw that the Lord had made his position safe as king over Israel, and that he had made his kingdom great because of his people Israel.
And David took more women and wives in Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron: and he had more sons and daughters.
These are the names of those whose birth took place in Jerusalem: Shammua and Shobab and Nathan and Solomon
And Ibhar and Elishua and Nepheg and Japhia
And Elishama and Eliada and Eliphelet.
And when the Philistines had news that David had been made king over Israel, they all went up in search of David; and David, hearing of it, went down to the strong place.
And when the Philistines came, they went in every direction in the valley of Rephaim.
And David, desiring directions from the Lord, said, Am I to go up against the Philistines? will you give them up into my hands? And the Lord said, Go up, for I will certainly give up the Philistines into your hands.
And David went to Baal-perazim, and overcame them there; and he said, The Lord has let the forces fighting against me be broken before me as a wall is broken by rushing waters. So that place was named Baal-perazim.
And the Philistines, when they went in flight, did not take their images with them, and David and his men took them away.
And the Philistines came up again, and went in every direction in the valley of Rephaim.
And when David went for directions to the Lord, he said, You are not to go up against them in front; but make a circle round them from the back and come on them opposite the spice-trees.
Then at the sound of footsteps in the tops of the trees, go forward quickly, for the Lord has gone out before you to overcome the army of the Philistines.
And David did as the Lord had said; and he overcame the Philistines, attacking them from Gibeon to near Gezer.
And David got together all the fighting-men of Israel to the number of thirty thousand;
And David, and all the people who were with him, went to Baal of Judah to get the ark of God, over which the holy name is named, the name of the Lord of armies, whose place is between the winged ones.
And they put the ark of God on a new cart and took it out of the house of Abinadab which was on the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were the drivers of the cart.
And Uzzah went by the side of the ark, while Ahio went before it.
And David and all the men of Israel made melody before the Lord with all their power, with songs and with corded instruments and instruments of brass.
And when they came to Nacon's grain-floor, Uzzah put his hand on the ark of God to keep it safe in its place, for the oxen were out of control.
And the wrath of the Lord, burning against Uzzah, sent destruction on him because he had put his hand on the ark, and death came to him there by the ark of God.
And David was angry because of the Lord's outburst of wrath against Uzzah: and he gave that place the name Perez-uzzah, which is its name to this day.
And such was David's fear of the Lord that day, that he said, How may I let the ark of God come to me?
So David did not let the ark of the Lord come back to him to the town of David: but had it turned away and put into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
And the ark of the Lord was in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months: and the Lord sent a blessing on Obed-edom and all his family.
And they said to King David , The blessing of the Lord is on the family of Obed-edom and on all he has , because of the ark of God . And David went and took the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the town of David
with joy .
And when those who were lifting the ark of the Lord had gone six steps, he made an offering of an ox and a fat young beast.
And David, clothed in a linen ephod, was dancing before the Lord with all his strength.
So David and all the men of Israel took up the ark of the Lord with cries of joy and sounding of horns.
And when the ark of the Lord came into the town of David, Michal, Saul's daughter, looking out of the window, saw King David dancing and jumping before the Lord; and to her mind he seemed foolish.
And they took in the ark of the Lord, and put it in its place inside the tent which David had put up for it: and David made burned offerings and peace-offerings to the Lord.
And after David had made the burned offerings and the peace-offerings, he gave the people a blessing in the name of the Lord of armies.
And he gave to every man and woman among all the people, among all the masses of Israel, a cake of bread and a measure of wine and a cake of dry grapes. Then all the people went away, every man to his house.
Then David came back to give a blessing to his family . And Michal , Saul ' s daughter , came out to him and said , How full of glory was the king of Israel today , who let himself be seen uncovered by his servant-girls like a foolish
person uncovering himself without shame !
And David said to Michal , I was dancing before the Lord , who put me over your father and all his sons , to make me a ruler over the people of the Lord , over his people Israel : and I will go on playing before the Lord
And I will do even worse than this, and make myself even lower in your eyes: but the servant-girls of whom you were talking will give me honour.
And Michal, Saul's daughter, had no child till the day of her death.
Now when the king was living in his house, and the Lord had given him rest from war on every side;
The king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of God is housed inside the curtains of a tent.
And Nathan said to the king, Go and do whatever is in your heart; for the Lord is with you.
Now that night the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying,
Go and say to my servant David, The Lord says, Are you to be the builder of a house, a living-place for me?
For from the day when I took the children of Israel up out of Egypt till this day, I have had no house, but have gone from place to place in a tent.
In all the places where I went with all the children of Israel, did I ever say to any of the judges of Israel, to whom I gave the care of my people Israel, Why have you not made me a house of cedar?
Then say these words to my servant David, The Lord of armies says, I took you from the fields, from keeping the sheep, so that you might be a ruler over my people, over my people Israel:
And I have been with you wherever you went, cutting off before you all those who were against you; and I will make your name great, like the name of the greatest ones of the earth.
And I will make a resting-place for my people Israel , planting them there , so that they may be living in the place which is theirs , and never again be moved ; and never again will they be troubled by evil men as they were at the first
From the time when I put judges over my people Israel; and I will give you peace from all who are against you. And the Lord says to you that he will make you the head of a line of kings.
And when the time comes for you to go to rest with your fathers, I will put in your place your seed after you, the offspring of your body, and I will make his kingdom strong.
He will be the builder of a house for my name, and I will make the seat of his authority certain for ever.
I will be to him a father and he will be to me a son: if he does wrong, I will give him punishment with the rod of men and with the blows of the children of men;
But my mercy will not be taken away from him, as I took it from him who was before you.
And your family and your kingdom will keep their place before me for ever: the seat of your authority will never be overturned.
So Nathan gave David an account of all these words and this vision.
Then David the king went in and took his seat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my family, that you have been my guide till now?
And this was only a small thing to you, O Lord God; but your words have even been about the far-off future of your servant's family, O Lord God!
What more may David say to you? for you have knowledge of your servant, O Lord God.
Because of your word and from your heart, you have done all this great work, and let your servant see it.
Truly you are great, O Lord God: there is no one like you and no other God but you, as is clear from everything which has come to our ears.
And what other nation in the earth , like your people Israel , did a god go out to take for himself , to be his people , and to make a name for himself , and to do great and strange things for them , driving out a nation
and its gods from before his people ?
But you took and made strong for yourself your people Israel, to be your people for ever; and you, Lord, became their God.
And now, O Lord God, may the word which you have said about your servant and about his family, be made certain for ever, and may you do as you have said!
And let your name be made great for ever, and let men say, The Lord of armies is God over Israel: and let the family of David your servant be made strong before you!
For you, O Lord of armies, the God of Israel, have clearly said to your servant, I will make you the head of a family of kings: and so it has come into your servant's heart to make this prayer to you.
And now, O Lord God, you are God and your words are true and you have said you will give your servant this good thing;
So may it be your pleasure to give your blessing to the family of your servant , so that it may go on for ever before you : ( for you , O Lord God , have said it , ) and may your blessing be on your servant '
s family line for ever !
And it came about after this that David made an attack on the Philistines and overcame them; and David took the authority of the mother-town from the hands of the Philistines.
And he overcame the Moabites, and he had them measured with a line when they were stretched out on the earth; marking out two lines for death and one full line for life. So the Moabites became servants to David and gave him offerings.
And David overcame Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, when he went to make his power seen by the River.
And David took from him one thousand, seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen: and David had the leg-muscles of the horses cut, only keeping enough of them for a hundred war-carriages.
And when the Aramaeans of Damascus came to the help of Hadadezer, king of Zobah, David put to the sword twenty-two thousand of the Aramaeans.
And David put armed forces in Aram of Damascus: and the Aramaeans became servants to David and gave him offerings. And the Lord made David overcome wherever he went.
And David took their gold body-covers from the servants of Hadadezer and took them to Jerusalem.
And from Tebah and Berothai, towns of Hadadezer, King David took a great store of brass.
And when Tou, king of Hamath, had news that David had overcome all the army of Hadadezer,
He sent his son Hadoram to David, with words of peace and blessing, because he had overcome Hadadezer in the fight, for Hadadezer had wars with Tou; and Hadoram took with him vessels of silver and gold and brass:
These King David made holy to the Lord, together with the silver and gold which he had taken from the nations he had overcome--
The nations of Edom and Moab, and the children of Ammon and the Philistines and the Amalekites and the goods he had taken from Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
And David got great honour for himself, when he came back, by the destruction of Edom in the valley of Salt, to the number of eighteen thousand men.
And he put armed forces in Edom; all through Edom he had armed forces stationed, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the Lord made David overcome wherever he went.
And David was king over all Israel, judging and giving right decisions for all his people.
And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the army; and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was keeper of the records;
And Zadok and Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, were priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;
And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were priests.
And David said, Is there still anyone of Saul's family living, so that I may be a friend to him, because of Jonathan?
Now there was of Saul's people a servant named Ziba, and they sent him to David; and the king said to him, Are you Ziba? And he said, I am.
And the king said, Is there anyone of Saul's family still living, to whom I may be a friend in God's name? And Ziba said, There is a son of Jonathan, whose feet are damaged.
And the king said to him, Where is he? And Ziba said to the king, He is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.
Then King David sent, and had him taken from Lo-debar, from the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel.
And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, came to David, and falling down on his face, gave him honour. And David said, Mephibosheth. And answering he said, Your servant is here.
And David said to him , Have no fear : for truly I will be good to you , because of your father Jonathan , and I will give back to you all the land which was Saul ' s ; and you will have a place at my table
at all times .
And he went down on his face before the king, and said, What is your servant, for you to take note of a dead dog such as I am?
Then the king sent for Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, All the property of Saul and of his family I have given to your master's son.
And you and your sons and your servants are to take care of the land for him , and get in the fruit of it , so that your master ' s son may have food : but Mephibosheth , your master ' s son , will have a place
at my table at all times . Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants .
Then Ziba said to the king, Every order which you have given to your servant will be done. As for Mephibosheth, he had a place at David's table, like one of the king's sons.
And Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica. And all the people living in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.
So Mephibosheth went on living in Jerusalem; for he took all his meals at the king's table; and he had not the use of his feet.
The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa; what he saw about Israel in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earth-shock.
And he said, The Lord will give a lion's cry from Zion, his voice will be sounding from Jerusalem; and the fields of the keepers of sheep will become dry, and the top of Carmel will be wasted away.
These are the words of the Lord: For three crimes of Damascus, and for four, I will not let its fate be changed; because they have been crushing Gilead with iron grain-crushing instruments.
And I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, burning up the great houses of Ben-hadad.
And I will have the locks of the door of Damascus broken , and him who is seated in power cut off from the valley of Aven , and him in whose hand is the rod from the house of Eden ; and the people of Aram will go away
as prisoners into Kir , says the Lord .
These are the words of the Lord: For three crimes of Gaza, and for four, I will not let its fate be changed; because they took all the people away prisoners, to give them up to Edom.
And I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, burning up its great houses:
Him who is seated in power I will have cut off from Ashdod, and him in whose hand is the rod from Ashkelon; and my hand will be turned against Ekron, and the rest of the Philistines will come to destruction, says the Lord God.
These are the words of the Lord: For three crimes of Tyre, and for four, I will not let its fate be changed; because they gave up all the people prisoners to Edom, without giving a thought to the brothers' agreement between them.
And I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, burning up its great houses.
These are the words of the Lord : For three crimes of Edom , and for four , I will not let its fate be changed ; because his sword was turned against his brother , without pity , and his wrath was burning at all times , and he
was angry for ever .
And I will send a fire on Teman, burning up the great houses of Bozrah.
These are the words of the Lord : For three crimes of the children of Ammon , and for four , I will not let its fate be changed ; because in Gilead they had women with child cut open , so that they might make wider the limits of
their land .
And I will make a fire in the wall of Rabbah, burning up its great houses, with loud cries in the days of war, with a storm in the day of the great wind:
And their king will be made prisoner, he and his captains together, says the Lord.
These are the words of the Lord: For three crimes of Moab, and for four, I will not let its fate be changed; because he had the bones of the king of Edom burned to dust.
And I will send a fire on Moab, burning up the great houses of Kerioth: and death will come on Moab with noise and outcries and the sound of the horn:
And I will have the judge cut off from among them, and all their captains I will put to death with him, says the Lord.
These are the words of the Lord : For three crimes of Judah , and for four , I will not let its fate be changed ; because they have given up the law of the Lord , and have not kept his rules ; and their false ways ,
in which their fathers went , have made them go out of the right way .
And I will send a fire on Judah, burning up the great houses of Jerusalem.
These are the words of the Lord: For three crimes of Israel, and for four, I will not let its fate be changed; because they have given the upright man for silver, and the poor for the price of two shoes;
Crushing the head of the poor, and turning the steps of the gentle out of the way: and a man and his father go in to the same young woman, putting shame on my holy name:
By every altar they are stretched on clothing taken from those who are in their debt, drinking in the house of their god the wine of those who have made payment for wrongdoing.
Though I sent destruction on the Amorite before them, who was tall as the cedar and strong as the oak-tree, cutting off his fruit from on high and his roots from under the earth.
And I took you up out of the land of Egypt, guiding you for forty years in the waste land, so that you might take for your heritage the land of the Amorite.
And some of your sons I made prophets, and some of your young men I made separate for myself. Is it not even so, O children of Israel? says the Lord.
But to those who were separate you gave wine for drink; and to the prophets you said, Be prophets no longer.
See, I am crushing you down, as one is crushed under a cart full of grain.
And flight will be impossible for the quick-footed, and the force of the strong will become feeble, and the man of war will not get away safely:
And the bowman will not keep his place; he who is quick-footed will not get away safely: and the horseman will not keep his life.
And he who is without fear among the fighting men will go in flight without his clothing in that day, says the Lord.
Give ear to this word which the Lord has said against you, O children of Israel, against all the family which I took up out of the land of Egypt, saying,
You only of all the families of the earth have I taken care of: for this reason I will send punishment on you for all your sins.
Is it possible for two to go walking together, if not by agreement?
Will a lion give his loud cry in the woodland when no food is there? will the voice of the young lion be sounding from his hole if he has taken nothing?
Is it possible for a bird to be taken in a net on the earth where no net has been put for him? will the net come up from the earth if it has taken nothing at all?
If the horn is sounded in the town will the people not be full of fear? will evil come on a town if the Lord has not done it?
Certainly the Lord will do nothing without making clear his secret to his servants, the prophets.
The cry of the lion is sounding; who will not have fear? The Lord God has said the word; is it possible for the prophet to keep quiet?
Give out the news in the great houses of Assyria and in the land of Egypt, and say, Come together on the mountains of Samaria, and see what great outcries are there, and what cruel acts are done in it.
For they have no knowledge of how to do what is right, says the Lord, who are storing up violent acts and destruction in their great houses.
For this reason, says the Lord, an attacker will come, shutting in the land on every side; and your strength will come down and your great houses will be made waste.
These are the words of the Lord : As the keeper of sheep takes out of the mouth of the lion two legs or part of an ear ; so will the children of Israel be made safe , who are resting in Samaria on seats of honour or on
the silk cushions of a bed .
Give ear now, and give witness against the family of Jacob, says the Lord God, the God of armies;
For in the day when I give Israel punishment for his sins, I will send punishment on the altars of Beth-el, and the horns of the altar will be cut off and come down to the earth.
And I will send destruction on the winter house with the summer house; the ivory houses will be falling down and the great houses will come to an end, says the Lord.
Give ear to this word, you cows of Bashan, who are in the hill of Samaria, by whom the poor are kept down, and those in need are crushed; who say to their lords, Get out the wine and give us drink.
The Lord God has taken an oath by his holy name, that the days are coming when they will take you away with hooks, and the rest of you with fish-hooks.
And you will go out through the broken places, every one going straight before her, and you will be sent into Harmon, says the Lord.
Come to Beth-el and do evil; to Gilgal, increasing the number of your sins; come with your offerings every morning and your tenths every three days:
Let that which is leavened be burned as a praise-offering, let the news of your free offerings be given out publicly; for this is pleasing to you, O children of Israel, says the Lord.
But in all your towns I have kept food from your teeth, and in all your places there has been need of bread: and still you have not come back to me, says the Lord.
And I have kept back the rain from you , when it was still three months before the grain-cutting : I sent rain on one town and kept it back from another : one part was rained on , and the part where there was no rain became a waste
So two or three towns went wandering to one town looking for water, and did not get enough: and still you have not come back to me, says the Lord.
I have sent destruction on your fields by burning and disease: the increase of your gardens and your vine-gardens, your fig-trees and your olive-trees, has been food for worms: and still you have not come back to me, says the Lord.
I have sent disease among you , as it was in Egypt : I have put your young men to the sword , and have taken away your horses ; I have made the evil smell from your tents come up to your noses : and still you have not
come back to me , says the Lord .
And I have sent destruction among you, as when God sent destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were like a burning stick pulled out of the fire: and still you have not come back to me, says the Lord.
So this is what I will do to you, O Israel: and because I will do this to you, be ready for a meeting with your God, O Israel.
For see , he who gave form to the mountains and made the wind , giving knowledge of his purpose to man , who makes the morning dark , and is walking on the high places of the earth : the Lord , the God of armies , is his
name .
Give ear to this word, my song of sorrow over you, O children of Israel.
The virgin of Israel has been made low, never again to be lifted up: she is stretched out by herself on her land; there is no one to put her on her feet again.
For these are the words of the Lord God: The town which was able to send out a thousand, will have only a hundred; and that which sent out a hundred, will have only ten, in Israel.
For these are the words of the Lord to the children of Israel: Let your hearts be turned to me, so that you may have life:
Do not be looking for help to Beth-el, and do not go to Gilgal, or make your way to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal will certainly be taken prisoner, and Beth-el will come to nothing.
Go to the Lord for help so that you may have life; for fear that he may come like fire bursting out in the family of Joseph, causing destruction, and there will be no one to put it out in Beth-el.
You who make the work of judging a bitter thing, crushing down righteousness to the earth;
Go for help to him who makes Orion and the Pleiades , by whom the deep dark is turned into morning , who makes the day black with night ; whose voice goes out to the waters of the sea , sending them out over the face of the earth
: the Lord is his name ;
Who sends sudden destruction on the strong, so that destruction comes on the walled town.
They have hate for him who makes protest against evil in the public place, and he whose words are upright is disgusting to them.
So because the poor man is crushed under your feet , and you take taxes from him of grain : you have made for yourselves houses of cut stone , but you will not take your rest in them ; the fair vine-gardens planted by your hands will not give
you wine .
For I have seen how your evil-doing is increased and how strong are your sins, you troublers of the upright, who take rewards and do wrong to the cause of the poor in the public place.
So the wise will say nothing in that time; for it is an evil time.
Go after good and not evil, so that life may be yours: and so the Lord, the God of armies, will be with you, as you say.
Be haters of evil and lovers of good, and let right be done in the public place: it may be that the Lord, the God of armies, will have mercy on the rest of Joseph.
So these are the words of the Lord , the God of armies , the Lord : There will be weeping in all the open spaces ; and in all the streets they will say , Sorrow ! sorrow ! and they will get in the farmer to the weeping
, and the makers of sad songs to give cries of grief .
In all the vine-gardens there will be cries of grief: for I will go through among you, says the Lord.
Sorrow to you who are looking for the day of the Lord! what is the day of the Lord to you? it is dark and not light.
As if a man, running away from a lion, came face to face with a bear; or went into the house and put his hand on the wall and got a bite from a snake.
Will not the day of the Lord be dark and not light? even very dark, with no light shining in it?
Your feasts are disgusting to me, I will have nothing to do with them; I will take no delight in your holy meetings.
Even if you give me your burned offerings and your meal offerings, I will not take pleasure in them: I will have nothing to do with the peace-offerings of your fat beasts.
Take away from me the noise of your songs; my ears are shut to the melody of your instruments.
But let the right go rolling on like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.
Did you come to me with offerings of beasts and meal offerings in the waste land for forty years, O Israel?
Truly, you will take up Saccuth your king and Kaiwan your images, the star of your god, which you made for yourselves.
And I will send you away as prisoners farther than Damascus, says the Lord, whose name is the God of armies.
Sorrow to those who are resting in comfort in Zion, and to those who have no fear of danger in the mountain of Samaria, the noted men of the chief of the nations, to whom the people of Israel come!
Go on to Calneh and see; and from there go to Hamath the great; then go down to Gath of the Philistines: are you better than these kingdoms? or is your land wider than theirs?
You who put far away the evil day, causing the rule of the violent to come near;
Who are resting on beds of ivory, stretched out on soft seats, feasting on lambs from the flock and young oxen from the cattle-house;
Making foolish songs to the sound of corded instruments, and designing for themselves instruments of music, like David;
Drinking wine in basins, rubbing themselves with the best oils; but they have no grief for the destruction of Joseph.
So now they will go away prisoners with the first of those who are made prisoners, and the loud cry of those who were stretched out will come to an end.
The Lord God has taken an oath by himself, says the Lord, the God of armies: the pride of Jacob is disgusting to me, and I have hate for his great houses: so I will give up the town with everything in it.
Then it will come about that if there are still ten men in a house, death will overtake them.
And when a man ' s relation , even the one who is responsible for burning his body , lifting him up to take his bones out of the house , says to him who is in the inmost part of the house , Is there still anyone with you
? and he says , No ; then he will say , Keep quiet , for the name of the Lord may not be named .
For see, at the order of the Lord the great house will be full of cracks and the little house will be broken.
Is it possible for horses to go running on the rock? may the sea be ploughed with oxen? for the right to be turned by you into poison, and the fruit of righteousness into a bitter plant?
You whose joy is in a thing of no value, who say, Have we not taken for ourselves horns by the strength which is ours?
For see, I will send against you a nation, O Israel, says the Lord, the God of armies, ruling you cruelly from the way into Hamath as far as the stream of the Arabah.
This is what the Lord God let me see: and I saw that, when the growth of the late grass was starting, he made locusts; it was the late growth after the king's cutting was done.
And it came about that after they had taken all the grass of the land, I said, O Lord God, have mercy: how will Jacob be able to keep his place? for he is small.
The Lord, changing his purpose about this, said, It will not be.
This is what the Lord let me see : and I saw that the Lord God sent for a great fire to be the instrument of his punishment ; and , after burning up the great deep , it was about to put an end to the Lord ' s
heritage .
Then said I, O Lord God, let there be an end: how will Jacob be able to keep his place? for he is small.
The Lord, changing his purpose about this, said, And this will not be.
This is what he let me see: and I saw the Lord stationed by a wall made straight by a weighted line, and he had a weighted line in his hand.
And the Lord said to me , Amos , what do you see ? And I said , A weighted line . Then the Lord said , See , I will let down a weighted line among my people Israel ; never again will my eyes be shut to their
sin :
And the high places of Isaac will be unpeopled, and the holy places of Israel will be made waste; and I will come up against the family of Jeroboam with the sword.
Then Amaziah, the priest of Beth-el, sent to Jeroboam, king of Israel, saying, Amos has made designs against you among the people of Israel: the land is troubled by his words.
For Amos has said, Jeroboam will be put to the sword, and Israel will certainly be taken away as a prisoner out of his land.
And Amaziah said to Amos, O seer, go in flight into the land of Judah, and there get your living by working as a prophet:
But be a prophet no longer at Beth-el: for it is the holy place of the king, and the king's house.
Then Amos in answer said to Amaziah, I am no prophet, or one of the sons of the prophets; I am a herdman and one who takes care of sycamore-trees:
And the Lord took me from the flock, and the Lord said to me, Go, be a prophet to my people Israel.
Now then, give ear to the word of the Lord: You say, Be no prophet to Israel, and say not a word against the people of Isaac.
So this is what the Lord has said : Your wife will be a loose woman in the town , and your sons and your daughters will be put to the sword , and your land will be cut up into parts by a line ; and you yourself will
come to your end in an unclean land , and Israel will certainly be taken away a prisoner out of his land .
This is what the Lord God let me see: and I saw a basket of summer fruit.
And he said, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then the Lord said to me, The end has come to my people Israel; never again will my eyes be shut to their sin.
And the songs of the king's house will be cries of pain in that day, says the Lord God: great will be the number of the dead bodies, and everywhere they will put them out without a word.
Give ear to this, you who are crushing the poor, and whose purpose is to put an end to those who are in need in the land,
Saying , When will the new moon be gone , so that we may do trade in grain ? and the Sabbath , so that we may put out in the market the produce of our fields ? making the measure small and the price great , and trading falsely
with scales of deceit ;
Getting the poor for silver, and him who is in need for the price of two shoes, and taking a price for the waste parts of the grain.
The Lord has taken an oath by the pride of Jacob, Truly I will ever keep in mind all their works.
Will not the land be shaking with fear because of this, and everyone in it have sorrow? and all of it will be overflowing like the River; and it will be troubled and go down again like the River of Egypt.
And it will come about in that day, says the Lord God, that I will make the sun go down in the middle of the day, and I will make the earth dark in daylight:
Your feasts will be turned into sorrow and all your melody into songs of grief ; everyone will be clothed with haircloth , and the hair of every head will be cut ; I will make the weeping like that for an only son , and the end of it
like a bitter day .
See, the days are coming, says the Lord God, when I will send times of great need on the land, not need of food or desire for water, but for hearing the words of the Lord.
And they will go wandering from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, running here and there in search of the word of the Lord, and they will not get it.
In that day the fair virgins and the young men will be feeble from need of water.
Those who make their oaths by the sin of Samaria and say, By the life of your God, O Dan; and, By the living way of Beer-sheba; even they will go down, never again to be lifted up.
I saw the Lord stationed by the side of the altar , giving blows to the tops of the pillars so that the doorsteps were shaking : and he said , I will let all of them be broken with earth-shocks ; I will put the last of them to
the sword : if any one of them goes in flight he will not get away , not one of them will be safe .
Even if they go deep into the underworld, my hand will take them up from there; if they go up to heaven, I will get them down:
Though they take cover on the top of Carmel , I will go in search of them and get them out ; though they keep themselves from my eyes in the bed of the sea , I will give orders to the great snake there and he will give them
a bite :
And though they are taken away as prisoners by their attackers, even there will I give orders to the sword to put them to death: my eyes will be fixed on them for evil and not for good.
For the Lord , the God of armies , is he at whose touch the land is turned to water , and everyone in it will be given up to sorrow ; all of it will be overflowing like the River , and will go down again like the River
of Egypt ;
It is he who makes his rooms in the heaven, basing his arch on the earth; whose voice goes out to the waters of the sea, and sends them flowing over the face of the earth; the Lord is his name.
Are you not as the children of the Ethiopians to me, O children of Israel? says the Lord. Have I not taken Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Aramaeans from Kir?
See, the eyes of the Lord are on the evil kingdom, and I will put an end to it in all the earth; but I will not send complete destruction on Jacob, says the Lord.
For see, I will give orders, and I will have Israel moved about among all the nations, as grain is moved about by the shaking of the tray, but not the smallest seed will be dropped on the earth.
All those sinners among my people will be put to the sword who say, Evil will not overtake us or come face to face with us.
In that day I will put up the tent of David which has come down, and make good its broken places; and I will put up again his damaged walls, building it up as in the past;
So that the rest of Edom may be their heritage, and all the nations who have been named by my name, says the Lord, who is doing this.
See , the days will come , says the Lord , when the ploughman will overtake him who is cutting the grain , and the crusher of the grapes him who is planting seed ; and sweet wine will be dropping from the mountains , and the hills will be
turned into streams of wine .
And I will let the fate of my people Israel be changed , and they will be building up again the waste towns and living in them ; they will again be planting vine-gardens and taking the wine for their drink ; and they will make gardens and get the
fruit of them .
And I will have them planted in their land, and never again will they be uprooted from their land which I have given them, says the Lord your God.
In the third year of the rule of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem, shutting it in with his forces.
And the Lord gave into his hands Jehoiakim , king of Judah , with some of the vessels of the house of God ; and he took them away into the land of Shinar to the house of his god ; and he put the vessels into the store-house of
his god .
And the king gave orders to Ashpenaz, the captain of his unsexed servants, to take in some of the children of Israel, certain of the king's family, and those of high birth;
Young men who were strong and healthy, good-looking, and trained in all wisdom, having a good education and much knowledge, and able to take positions in the king's house; and to have them trained in the writing and language of the Chaldaeans.
And a regular amount of food and wine every day from the king ' s table was ordered for them by the king ; and they were to be cared for for three years so that at the end of that time they might take their places before the king
And among these there were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
And the captain of the unsexed servants gave them names; to Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar, to Hananiah the name of Shadrach, to Mishael the name of Meshach, and to Azariah the name of Abed-nego.
And Daniel had come to the decision that he would not make himself unclean with the king's food or wine; so he made a request to the captain of the unsexed servants that he might not make himself unclean.
And God put into the heart of the captain of the unsexed servants kind feelings and pity for Daniel.
And the captain of the unsexed servants said to Daniel , I am in fear of my lord the king , who has given orders about your food and your drink ; what if he sees you looking less happy than the other young men of your generation ? then
you would have put my head in danger from the king .
Then Daniel said to the keeper in whose care the captain of the unsexed servants had put Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
Put your servants to the test for ten days; let them give us grain for our food and water for our drink.
Then take a look at our faces and the faces of the young men who have food from the king's table; and, having seen them, do to your servants as it seems right to you.
So he gave ear to them in this thing and put them to the test for ten days.
And at the end of ten days their faces seemed fairer and they were fatter in flesh than all the young men who had their food from the king's table.
So the keeper regularly took away their meat and the wine which was to have been their drink, and gave them grain.
Now as for these four young men, God gave them knowledge and made them expert in all book-learning and wisdom: and Daniel was wise in all visions and dreams.
Now at the end of the time fixed by the king for them to go in, the captain of the unsexed servants took them in to Nebuchadnezzar.
And the king had talk with them; and among them all there was no one like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; so they were given places before the king.
And in any business needing wisdom and good sense, about which the king put questions to them, he saw that they were ten times better than all the wonder-workers and users of secret arts in all his kingdom.
And Daniel went on till the first year of King Cyrus.
In the third year of Cyrus, king of Persia, a secret was unfolded to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, even a hard work: and he had knowledge of it, and the vision was clear to him.
In those days I, Daniel, gave myself up to grief for three full weeks.
I had no pleasing food, no meat or wine came into my mouth, and I put no oil on my body till three full weeks were ended.
And on the twenty-fourth day of the first month I was by the side of the great river;
And lifting up my eyes I saw the form of a man clothed in a linen robe, and round him there was a band of gold, of the best gold:
And his body was like the beryl , and his face had the look of a thunder-flame , and his eyes were like burning lights , and his arms and feet like the colour of polished brass , and the sound of his voice was like the sound of an
army .
And I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see it; but a great shaking came on them and they went in flight to take cover.
So I was by myself, and I saw this great vision, and all my strength went from me; and the colour went from my face.
But the sound of his words came to my ears, and on hearing his voice I went into a deep sleep with my face to the earth.
Then a hand gave me a touch, awaking me, and putting me on my knees and my hands.
And he said to me , O Daniel , you man dearly loved , take in the sense of the words I say to you and get up on to your feet : for to you I am now sent ; and when he had said this to me I
got on to my feet , shaking with fear .
Then he said to me , Have no fear , Daniel ; for from the first day when you gave your heart to getting wisdom and making yourself poor in spirit before your God , your words have come to his ears : and I have come because of your
words .
But the angel of the kingdom of Persia put himself against me for twenty-one days; but Michael, one of the chief angels, came to my help; and when I came he was still there with the angel of the kings of Persia.
Now I have come to give you knowledge of the fate of your people in the later days; for there is still a vision for the days.
And after he had said these words to me, I kept my face turned to the earth and was unable to say anything.
Then one whose form was like the sons of men put his finger on my lips ; and opening my mouth , I said to him who was before me , O my lord , because of the vision my pains have come on me , and I have no
more strength .
For how may this servant of my lord have talk with my lord? for, as for me, straight away my strength went from me and there was no breath in my body.
Then again one having the form of a man put his hand on me and gave me strength.
And he said to me , O man greatly loved , have no fear : peace be with you , be strong and let your heart be lifted up . And at his words I became strong , and said , Let my lord say on , for you have
given me strength .
Then he said, It is clear to you why I have come to you. And now I will give you an account of what is recorded in the true writings:
But I am going back to make war with the angel of Persia, and when I am gone, the angel of Greece will come. And there is no one on my side against these, but Michael, your angel.
And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede I was on his side to make his position safe and make him strong.
And now I will make clear to you what is true . There are still three kings to come in Persia , and the fourth will have much greater wealth than all of them : and when he has become strong through his wealth , he will put his forces
in motion against all the kingdoms of Greece .
And a strong king will come to power, ruling with great authority and doing whatever is his pleasure.
And when he has become strong , his kingdom will be broken and parted to the four winds of heaven ; but not to his offspring , for it will be uprooted ; and his kingdom will be for the others and not for these : but not with the
same authority as his .
And the king of the south will be strong, but one of his captains will be stronger than he and will be ruler; and his rule will be a great rule.
And at the end of years they will be joined together ; and the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make an agreement : but she will not keep the strength of her arm ; and his offspring will not
keep their place ; but she will be uprooted , with those who were the cause of her coming , and her son , and he who took her in those times .
But out of a branch from her roots one will come up to take his place, who will come against the army, forcing his way into the strong place of the king of the north, and he will take them in hand and overcome them:
And their gods and their metal images and their fair vessels of silver and gold he will take away into the south; and for some years he will keep away from the king of the north.
And he will come into the kingdom of the king of the south, but he will go back to his land.
And his son will make war, and will get together an army of great forces, and he will make an attack on him, overflowing and going past: and he will again take the war even to his strong place.
And the king of the south will be moved with wrath, and will come out and make war on him, on this same king of the north: and he will get together a great army, but the army will be given into his hand.
And the army will be taken away, and his heart will be uplifted: he will be the cause of the downfall of tens of thousands, but he will not be strong.
And again the king of the north will get together an army greater than the first; and he will make an attack on him at the end of years, with a great army and much wealth.
In those times, a number will take up arms against the king of the south: and the children of the violent among your people will be lifting themselves up to make the vision come true; but it will be their downfall.
So the king of the north will come , and put up earthworks and take a well-armed town : and the forces of the king of the south will make an attempt to keep their position , even the best of his army , but they will not have strength
to do so .
And he who comes against him will do his pleasure, and no one will be able to keep his place before him: he will take up his position in the beautiful land and in his hand there will be destruction.
And it will be his purpose to come with the strength of all his kingdom , but in place of this he will make an agreement with him ; and he will give him the daughter of women to send destruction on it ; but this will not take place
or come about .
After this , his face will be turned to the islands , and he will take a number of them : but a chief , by his destruction , will put an end to the shame offered by him ; and more than this , he will make his shame
come back on him .
Then his face will be turned to the strong places of his land: but his way will be stopped, causing his downfall, and he will not be seen again.
Then his place will be taken by one who will send out a man with the glory of a king to get wealth together; but after a short time destruction will overtake him, but not in wrath or in the fight.
And his place will be taken by a low person, to whom the honour of the kingdom had not been given: but he will come in time of peace and will get the kingdom by fair words.
And his forces will be completely taken away from before him and broken; and even the ruler of the agreement will have the same fate.
And from the time when they make an agreement with him, he will be working falsely: for he will take up arms suddenly with a small force,
Against fertile places , and will make waste a part of the country ; and he will do what his fathers have not done , or his fathers ' fathers ; he will make distribution among them of goods taken in war and by force , and of property :
he will even make designs against the strong places for a time .
And he will put in motion his power and his strength against the king of the south with a great army ; and the king of the south will go to war with a very great and strong army : but he will be forced to give way , because
of their designs against him ;
And his fears will overcome him and be the cause of his downfall, and his army will come to complete destruction, and a great number will be put to the sword.
And as for these two kings, their hearts will be fixed on doing evil and they will say false words at one table; but it will come to nothing: for the end will be at the time fixed.
And he will go back to his land with great wealth; and his heart will be against the holy agreement; and he will do his pleasure and go back to his land.
At the time fixed he will come back and come into the south; but in the later time it will not be as it was before.
For those who go out from the west will come against him , and he will be in fear and will go back , full of wrath against the holy agreement ; and he will do his pleasure : and he will go back and be united with those who
have given up the holy agreement .
And armies sent by him will take up their position and they will make unclean the holy place, even the strong place, and take away the regular burned offering and put in its place an unclean thing causing fear.
And those who do evil against the agreement will be turned to sin by his fair words: but the people who have knowledge of their God will be strong and do well.
And those who are wise among the people will be the teachers of the mass of the people: but they will come to their downfall by the sword and by the flame, being made prisoners and undergoing loss for a long time.
Now at the time of their downfall they will have a little help, but numbers will be joined to them in the town, and in their separate heritages.
And some of those who are wise will have wisdom in testing themselves and making themselves clean, till the time of the end: for it is still for the fixed time.
And the king will do his pleasure ; he will put himself on high , lifting himself over every god , and saying things to be wondered at against the God of gods ; and all will be well for him till the wrath is complete ; for what has
been purposed will be done .
He will have no respect for the gods of his fathers or for the god desired by women; he will have no respect for any god: for he will put himself on high over all.
But in place of this he will give honour to the god of armed places, and to a god of whom his fathers had no knowledge he will give honour with gold and silver and jewels and things to be desired.
And he will make use of the people of a strange god to keep his strongest places ; to those whom he takes note of he will give high honour : and he will make them rulers over the mass of the people , and will make division of the
land for a price .
And at the time of the end , the king of the south will make an attack on him : and the king of the north will come against him like a storm-wind , with war-carriages and horsemen and numbers of ships ; and he will go through many lands
like overflowing waters .
And he will come into the beautiful land, and tens of thousands will be overcome: but these will be kept from falling into his hands: Edom and Moab and the chief of the children of Ammon.
And his hand will be stretched out on the countries: and the land of the south will not be safe from him.
But he will have power over the stores of gold and silver, and over all the valued things of the south: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians will be at his steps.
But he will be troubled by news from the east and from the north; and he will go out in great wrath, to send destruction on, and put an end to, great numbers.
He will put the tents of his great house between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain: but he will come to his end with no helper.
And at that time Michael will take up his place , the great angel , who is the supporter of the children of your people : and there will be a time of trouble , such as there never was from the time there was a nation even till that
same time : and at that time your people will be kept safe , everyone who is recorded in the book .
And a number of those who are sleeping in the dust of the earth will come out of their sleep, some to eternal life and some to eternal shame.
And those who are wise will be shining like the light of the outstretched sky; and those by whom numbers have been turned to righteousness will be like the stars for ever and ever.
But as for you, O Daniel, let the words be kept secret and the book rolled up and kept shut till the time of the end: numbers will be going out of the way and troubles will be increased.
Then I, Daniel, looking, saw two others, one at the edge of the river on this side and one at the edge of the river on that side.
And I said to the man clothed in linen, who was over the waters of the river, How long will it be to the end of these wonders?
Then in my hearing the man clothed in linen , who was over the river , lifting up his right hand and his left hand to heaven , took an oath by him who is living for ever that it would be a time , times , and a half
; and when the power of the crusher of the holy people comes to an end , all these things will be ended .
And the words came to my ears, but the sense of them was not clear to me: then I said, O my lord, what is the sense of these things?
And he said, Go on your way, Daniel: for the words are secret and shut up till the time of the end;
Till a number are tested and make themselves clean; and the evil-doers will do evil; for not one of the evil-doers will have knowledge; but all will be made clear to those who are wise.
And from the time when the regular burned offering is taken away, and an unclean thing causing fear is put up, there will be a thousand, two hundred and ninety days.
A blessing will be on the man who goes on waiting, and comes to the thousand, three hundred and thirty-five days.
But you, go on your way and take your rest: for you will be in your place at the end of the days.
In the second year of the rule of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; and his spirit was troubled and his sleep went from him.
Then the king gave orders that the wonder-workers , and the users of secret arts , and those who made use of evil powers , and the Chaldaeans , were to be sent for to make clear to the king his dreams . So they came and took their places
before the king .
And the king said to them, I have had a dream, and my spirit is troubled by the desire to have the dream made clear to me.
Then the Chaldaeans said to the king in the Aramaean language, O King, have life for ever: give your servants an account of your dream, and we will make clear to you the sense of it.
The king made answer and said to the Chaldaeans, This is my decision: if you do not make clear to me the dream and the sense of it, you will be cut in bits and your houses made waste.
But if you make clear the dream and the sense of it, you will have from me offerings and rewards and great honour: so make clear to me the dream and the sense of it.
A second time they said in answer, Let the king give his servants an account of his dream, and we will make clear the sense.
The king made answer and said, I am certain that you are attempting to get more time, because you see that my decision is fixed;
That if you do not make my dream clear to me there is only one fate for you : for you have made ready false and evil words to say before me till the times are changed : so give me an account of the dream , and I will
be certain that you are able to make the sense of it clear .
Then the Chaldaeans said to the king in answer , There is not a man on earth able to make clear the king ' s business ; for no king , however great his power , has ever made such a request to any wonder-worker or user of secret arts
or Chaldaean .
The king's request is a very hard one, and there is no other who is able to make it clear to the king, but the gods, whose living-place is not with flesh.
Because of this the king was angry and full of wrath, and gave orders for the destruction of all the wise men of Babylon.
So the order went out that the wise men were to be put to death; and they were looking for Daniel and his friends to put them to death.
Then Daniel gave an answer with wisdom and good sense to Arioch, the captain of the king's armed men, who had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon;
He made answer and said to Arioch, O captain of the king, why is the king's order so cruel? Then Arioch gave Daniel an account of the business.
And Daniel went in and made a request to the king to give him time and he would make clear the sense of his dream to the king.
And Daniel went to his house and gave his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah the news:
So that they might make a request for the mercy of the God of heaven in the question of this secret; so that Daniel and his friends might not come to destruction with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
Then the secret was made clear to Daniel in a vision of the night. And Daniel gave blessing to the God of heaven.
And Daniel said in answer, May the name of God be praised for ever and ever: for wisdom and strength are his:
By him times and years are changed: by him kings are taken away and kings are lifted up: he gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to those whose minds are awake:
He is the unveiler of deep and secret things: he has knowledge of what is in the dark, and the light has its living-place with him.
I give you praise and worship, O God of my fathers, who have given me wisdom and strength, and have now made clear to me what we were requesting from you: for you have given us knowledge of the king's business.
For this reason Daniel went to Arioch , to whom the king had given orders for the destruction of the wise men of Babylon , and said to him , Do not put to death the wise men of Babylon : take me in before the king and I will
make clear to him the sense of the dream .
Then Arioch quickly took Daniel in before the king, and said to him, Here is a man from among the prisoners of Judah, who will make clear to the king the sense of the dream.
The king made answer and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are you able to make clear to me the dream which I saw and its sense?
Then Daniel said in answer to the king, No wise men, or users of secret arts, or wonder-workers, or readers of signs, are able to make clear to the king the secret he is searching for;
But there is a God in heaven, the unveiler of secrets, and he has given to King Nebuchadnezzar knowledge of what will take place in the last days. Your dreams and the visions of your head on your bed are these:
As for you, O King, the thoughts which came to you on your bed were of what will come about after this: and the unveiler of secrets has made clear to you what is to come.
As for me , this secret is not made clear to me because of any wisdom which I have more than any living man , but in order that the sense of the dream may be made clear to the king , and that you may have knowledge of the
thoughts of your heart .
You, O King, were looking, and a great image was there. This image, which was very great, and whose glory was very bright, was placed before you: its form sent fear into the heart.
As for this image, its head was made of the best gold, its breast and its arms were of silver, its middle and its sides were of brass,
Its legs of iron, its feet were in part of iron and in part of potter's earth.
While you were looking at it, a stone was cut out, but not by hands, and it gave the image a blow on its feet, which were of iron and earth, and they were broken in bits.
Then the iron and the earth , the brass and the silver and the gold , were smashed together , and became like the dust on the floors where grain is crushed in summer ; and the wind took them away so that no sign of them was to be
seen : and the stone which gave the image a blow became a great mountain , covering all the earth .
This is the dream; and we will make clear to the king the sense of it.
You, O King, king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory,
Wherever the children of men are living; into whose hands he has given the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven, and has made you ruler over them all, you are the head of gold.
And after you another kingdom, lower than you, will come to power; and a third kingdom, of brass, ruling over all the earth.
And the fourth kingdom will be strong as iron: because, as all things are broken and overcome by iron, so it will have the power of crushing and smashing down all the earth.
And as you saw the feet and toes , part of potter ' s work and part of iron , there will be a division in the kingdom ; but there will be some of the strength of iron in it , because you saw the iron mixed with the
potter ' s earth .
And as the toes of the feet were in part of iron and in part of earth, so part of the kingdom will be strong and part of it will readily be broken.
And as you saw the iron mixed with earth, they will give their daughters to one another as wives: but they will not be united one with another, even as iron is not mixed with earth.
And in the days of those kings , the God of heaven will put up a kingdom which will never come to destruction , and its power will never be given into the hands of another people , and all these kingdoms will be broken and overcome by it ,
but it will keep its place for ever .
Because you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands , and that by it the iron and the brass and the earth and the silver and the gold were broken to bits , a great God has given the king knowledge of what is to
take place in the future : the dream is fixed , and its sense is certain .
Then King Nebuchadnezzar, falling down on his face, gave worship to Daniel, and gave orders for an offering and spices to be given to him;
And the king made answer to Daniel and said, Truly, your God is a God of gods and a Lord of kings, and an unveiler of secrets, for you have been able to make this secret clear.
Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him offerings in great number, and made him ruler over all the land of Babylon, and chief over all the wise men of Babylon.
And at Daniel's request, the king gave Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego authority over the business of the land of Babylon: but Daniel was kept near the king's person.
Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, sixty cubits high and six cubits wide: he put it up in the valley of Dura, in the land of Babylon.
And Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to get together all the captains , the chiefs , the rulers , the wise men , the keepers of public money , the judges , the overseers , and all the rulers of the divisions of the country , to come to see the
unveiling of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had put up .
Then the captains , the chiefs , the rulers , the wise men , the keepers of public money , the judges , the overseers , and all the rulers of the divisions of the country , came together to see the unveiling of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king
had put up ; and they took their places before the image which Nebuchadnezzar had put up .
Then one of the king's criers said in a loud voice, To you the order is given, O peoples, nations, and languages,
That when the sound of the horn , pipe , harp , trigon , psaltery , bagpipe , and all sorts of instruments , comes to your ears , you are to go down on your faces in worship before the image of gold which Nebuchadnezzar the king has put
up :
And anyone not falling down and worshipping will that same hour be put into a burning and flaming fire.
So at that time , all the people , when the sound of the horn , pipe , harp , trigon , psaltery , and all sorts of instruments , came to their ears , went down on their faces in worship before the image of gold which Nebuchadnezzar the
king had put up .
At that time certain Chaldaeans came near and made a statement against the Jews.
They made answer and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, O King, have life for ever.
You , O King , have given an order that every man , when the sound of the horn , pipe , harp , trigon , psaltery , bagpipe , and all sorts of instruments , comes to his ears , is to go down on his face in worship
before the image of gold :
And anyone not falling down and worshipping is to be put into a burning and flaming fire.
There are certain Jews whom you have put over the business of the land of Babylon , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego ; these men have not given attention to you , O King : they are not servants of your gods or worshippers of the gold image which
you have put up .
Then Nebuchadnezzar in his wrath and passion gave orders for Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego to be sent for. Then they made these men come in before the king.
Nebuchadnezzar made answer and said to them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that you will not be servants of my god or give worship to the image of gold which I have put up?
Now if you are ready , on hearing the sound of the horn , pipe , harp , trigon , psaltery , bagpipe , and all sorts of instruments , to go down on your faces in worship before the image which I have made , it is well :
but if you will not give worship , that same hour you will be put into a burning and flaming fire ; and what god is there who will be able to take you out of my hands ?
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answering Nebuchadnezzar the king, said, There is no need for us to give you an answer to this question.
If our God, whose servants we are, is able to keep us safe from the burning and flaming fire, and from your hands, O King, he will keep us safe.
But if not, be certain, O King, that we will not be the servants of your gods, or give worship to the image of gold which you have put up.
Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of wrath, and the form of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: and he gave orders that the fire was to be heated up seven times more than it was generally heated.
And he gave orders to certain strong men in his army to put cords on Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego and put them into the burning and flaming fire.
Then these men had cords put round them as they were, in their coats, their trousers, their hats, and their clothing, and were dropped into the burning and flaming fire.
And because the king's order was not to be put on one side, and the heat of the fire was so great, the men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego were burned to death by the flame of the fire.
And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, with the cords about them, went down into the burning and flaming fire.
Then King Nebuchadnezzar, full of fear and wonder, got up quickly, and said to his wise men, Did we not put three men in cords into the fire? and they made answer and said to the king, True, O King.
He made answer and said, Look! I see four men loose, walking in the middle of the fire, and they are not damaged; and the form of the fourth is like a son of the gods.
Then Nebuchadnezzar came near the door of the burning and flaming fire : he made answer and said , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego , you servants of the Most High God , come out and come here . Then Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego came out of
the fire .
And the captains , the chiefs , and the rulers , and the king ' s wise men who had come together , saw these men , over whose bodies the fire had no power , and not a hair of their heads was burned , and their coats were
not changed , and there was no smell of fire about them .
Nebuchadnezzar made answer and said , Praise be to the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego , who has sent his angel and kept his servants safe who had faith in him , and who put the king ' s word on one side and gave up their
bodies to the fire , so that they might not be servants or worshippers of any other god but their God .
And it is my decision that any people , nation , or language saying evil against the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego , will be cut to bits and their houses made waste : because there is no other god who is able to give salvation such
as this .
Then the king gave Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego even greater authority in the land of Babylon.
Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all the peoples, nations, and languages living in all the earth: May your peace be increased.
It has seemed good to me to make clear the signs and wonders which the Most High God has done with me.
How great are his signs! and how full of power are his wonders! his kingdom is an eternal kingdom and his rule goes on from generation to generation.
I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my place, and all things were going well for me in my great house:
I saw a dream which was a cause of great fear to me; I was troubled by the images of my mind on my bed, and by the visions of my head.
And I gave orders for all the wise men of Babylon to come in before me so that they might make clear to me the sense of my dream.
Then the wonder-workers, the users of secret arts, the Chaldaeans, and the readers of signs came in to me: and I put the dream before them but they did not make clear the sense of it to me.
But at last Daniel came in before me, he whose name was Belteshazzar, after the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and I put the dream before him, saying,
O Belteshazzar, master of the wonder-workers, because I am certain that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and you are troubled by no secret; this is the dream which I saw: make clear to me its sense.
On my bed I saw a vision: there was a tree in the middle of the earth, and it was very high.
And the tree became tall and strong, stretching up to heaven, and to be seen from the ends of the earth:
Its leaves were fair and it had much fruit, and in it was food enough for all: the beasts of the field had shade under it, and the birds of heaven were resting in its branches, and it gave food to all living things.
In the visions of my head on my bed I saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven,
Crying out with a loud voice ; and this is what he said : Let the tree be cut down and its branches broken off ; let its leaves be taken off and its fruit sent in every direction : let the beasts get away from under it and the
birds from its branches :
But keep its broken end and its roots still in the earth , even with a band of iron and brass ; let him have the young grass of the field for food , and let him be wet with the dew of heaven , and let his part be
with the beasts .
Let his heart be changed from that of a man, and the heart of a beast be given to him; and let seven times go by him.
This order is fixed by the watchers , and the decision is by the word of the holy ones : so that the living may be certain that the Most High is ruler over the kingdom of men , and gives it to any man at his pleasure , lifting
up over it the lowest of men .
This dream I , King Nebuchadnezzar , saw ; and do you , O Belteshazzar , make clear the sense of it , for all the wise men of my kingdom are unable to make the sense of it clear to me ; but you are able , for the
spirit of the holy gods is in you .
Then Daniel , whose name was Belteshazzar , was at a loss for a time , his thoughts troubling him . The king made answer and said , Belteshazzar , do not be troubled by the dream or by the sense of it . Belteshazzar , answering , said ,
My lord , may the dream be about your haters , and its sense about those who are against you .
The tree which you saw, which became tall and strong, stretching up to heaven and seen from the ends of the earth;
Which had fair leaves and much fruit, and had in it food for all; under which the beasts of the field were living, and in the branches of which the birds of heaven had their resting-places:
It is you, O King, who have become great and strong: for your power is increased and stretching up to heaven, and your rule to the end of the earth.
And as for the vision which the king saw of a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven, saying, Let the tree be cut down and given to destruction;
This is the sense of it, O King, and it is the decision of the Most High which has come on my lord the king:
That they will send you out from among men , to be with the beasts of the field ; they will give you grass for your food like the oxen , and you will be wet with the dew of heaven , and seven times will go by you ,
till you are certain that the Most High is ruler in the kingdom of men , and gives it to any man at his pleasure .
And as they gave orders to let the broken end and the roots of the tree be, so your kingdom will be safe for you after it is clear to you that the heavens are ruling.
For this cause, O King, let my suggestion be pleasing to you, and let your sins be covered by righteousness and your evil-doing by mercy to the poor, so that the time of your well-being may be longer.
All this came to King Nebuchadnezzar.
At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of his great house in Babylon.
The king made answer and said, Is this not great Babylon, which I have made for the living-place of kings, by the strength of my power and for the glory of my honour?
While the word was still in the king's mouth, a voice came down from heaven, saying, O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is said: The kingdom has gone from you:
And they will send you out from among men , to be with the beasts of the field ; they will give you grass for your food like the oxen , and seven times will go by you , till you are certain that the Most High is ruler in
the kingdom of men , and gives it to any man at his pleasure .
That very hour the order about Nebuchadnezzar was put into effect : and he was sent out from among men , and had grass for his food like the oxen , and his body was wet with the dew of heaven , till his hair became long as eagles '
feathers and his nails like those of birds .
And at the end of the days , I , Nebuchadnezzar , lifting up my eyes to heaven , got back my reason , and , blessing the Most High , I gave praise and honour to him who is living for ever , whose rule is an eternal rule
and whose kingdom goes on from generation to generation .
And all the people of the earth are as nothing: he does his pleasure in the army of heaven and among the people of the earth: and no one is able to keep back his hand, or say to him, What are you doing?
At the same time my reason came back to me ; and for the glory of my kingdom , my honour and my great name came back to me ; and my wise men and my lords were turned to me again ; and I was made safe in my
kingdom and had more power than before .
Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, give worship and praise and honour to the King of heaven; for all his works are true and his ways are right: and those who go in pride he is able to make low.
Belshazzar the king made a great feast for a thousand of his lords, drinking wine before the thousand.
Belshazzar , while he was overcome with wine , gave orders for them to put before him the gold and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar , his father , had taken from the Temple in Jerusalem ; so that the king and his lords , his wives and his other women
, might take their drink from them .
Then they took in the gold and silver vessels which had been in the Temple of the house of God at Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives and his other women, took wine from them.
They took their wine and gave praise to the gods of gold and silver, of brass and iron and wood and stone.
In that very hour the fingers of a man's hand were seen, writing opposite the support for the light on the white wall of the king's house, and the king saw the part of the hand which was writing.
Then the colour went from the king's face, and he was troubled by his thoughts; strength went from his body, and his knees were shaking.
The king , crying out with a loud voice , said that the users of secret arts , the Chaldaeans , and the readers of signs , were to be sent for . The king made answer and said to the wise men of Babylon , Whoever is able to
make out this writing , and make clear to me the sense of it , will be clothed in purple and have a chain of gold round his neck , and will be a ruler of high authority in the kingdom .
Then all the king's wise men came in: but they were not able to make out the writing or give the sense of it to the king.
Then King Belshazzar was greatly troubled and the colour went from his face, and his lords were at a loss.
The queen , because of the words of the king and his lords , came into the house of the feast : the queen made answer and said , O King , have life for ever ; do not be troubled by your thoughts or let the colour go from
your face :
There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods ; and in the days of your father , light and reason like the wisdom of the gods were seen in him : and King Nebuchadnezzar , your father , made him master of
the wonder-workers , and the users of secret arts , and the Chaldaeans , and the readers of signs ;
Because a most special spirit , and knowledge and reason and the power of reading dreams and unfolding dark sayings and answering hard questions , were seen to be in him , even in Daniel ( named Belteshazzar by the king ) : now let Daniel be sent for ,
and he will make clear the sense of the writing .
Then they took Daniel in before the king; the king made answer and said to Daniel, So you are that Daniel, of the prisoners of Judah, whom my father took out of Judah.
And I have had news of you, that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that light and reason and special wisdom have been seen in you.
And now the wise men, the users of secret arts, have been sent in before me for the purpose of reading this writing and making clear to me the sense of it: but they are not able to make clear the sense of the thing:
And I have had news of you , that you have the power of making things clear , and of answering hard questions : now if you are able to make out the writing and give me the sense of it , you will be clothed in purple and have
a gold chain round your neck and be a ruler of high authority in the kingdom .
Then Daniel made answer and said to the king, Keep your offerings for yourself, and give your rewards to another; but I, after reading the writing to the king, will give him the sense of it.
As for you, O King, the Most High God gave to Nebuchadnezzar, your father, the kingdom and great power and glory and honour:
And because of the great power he gave him, all peoples and nations and languages were shaking in fear before him: some he put to death and others he kept living, at his pleasure, lifting up some and putting others down as it pleased him.
But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit became hard with pride, he was put down from his place as king, and they took his glory from him:
And he was sent out from among the sons of men ; and his heart was made like the beasts ' , and he was living with the asses of the fields ; he had grass for his food like the oxen , and his body was wet with the
dew of heaven , till he was certain that the Most High is ruler in the kingdom of men , and gives power over it to anyone at his pleasure .
And you, his son, O Belshazzar, have not kept your heart free from pride, though you had knowledge of all this;
But you have been lifting yourself up against the Lord of heaven , and they have put the vessels of his house before you , and you and your lords , your wives and your women , have taken wine in them ; and you have given praise to gods
of silver and gold , of brass and iron and wood and stone , who are without the power of seeing or hearing , and without knowledge : and to the God in whose hand your breath is , and whose are all your ways , you have not given
glory ;
Then the part of the hand was sent out from before him, and this writing was recorded.
And this is the writing which was recorded, Mene, tekel, peres.
This is the sense of the words: Mene; your kingdom has been numbered by God and ended.
Tekel; you have been put in the scales and seen to be under weight.
Peres; your kingdom has been cut up and given to the Medes and Persians.
Then, by the order of Belshazzar, they put a purple robe on Daniel, and a gold chain round his neck, and a public statement was made that he was to be a ruler of high authority in the kingdom.
That very night Belshazzar, the king of the Chaldaeans, was put to death.
And Darius the Mede took the kingdom, being then about sixty-two years old.
Darius was pleased to put over the kingdom a hundred and twenty captains, who were to be all through the kingdom;
And over them were three chief rulers, of whom Daniel was one; and the captains were to be responsible to the chief rulers, so that the king might undergo no loss.
Then this Daniel did his work better than the chief rulers and the captains, because there was a special spirit in him; and it was the king's purpose to put him over all the kingdom.
Then the chief rulers and the captains were looking for some cause for putting Daniel in the wrong in connection with the kingdom , but they were unable to put forward any wrongdoing or error against him ; because he was true , and no error or wrong was to
be seen in him .
Then these men said, We will only get a reason for attacking Daniel in connection with the law of his God.
Then these chief rulers and the captains came to the king and said to him, O King Darius, have life for ever.
All the chief rulers of the kingdom , the chiefs and the captains , the wise men and the rulers , have made a common decision to put in force a law having the king ' s authority , and to give a strong order , that whoever makes any
request to any god or man but you , O King , for thirty days , is to be put into the lions ' hole .
Now, O King, put the order in force, signing the writing so that it may not be changed, like the law of the Medes and Persians which may not come to an end.
For this reason King Darius put his name on the writing and the order.
And Daniel , on hearing that the writing had been signed , went into his house ; ( now he had windows in his room on the roof opening in the direction of Jerusalem ; ) and three times a day he went down on his knees in prayer and
praise before his God , as he had done before .
Then these men were watching and saw Daniel making prayers and requesting grace before his God.
Then they came near before the king and said , O King , have you not put your name to an order that any man who makes a request to any god or man but you , O King , for thirty days , is to be put into the
lions ' hole ? The king made answer and said , The thing is fixed by the law of the Medes and Persians which may not come to an end .
Then they made answer and said before the king, Daniel, one of the prisoners of Judah, has no respect for you, O King, or for the order signed by you, but three times a day he makes his prayer to God.
When this thing came to the king's ears, it was very evil to him, and his heart was fixed on keeping Daniel safe, and till the going down of the sun he was doing everything in his power to get him free.
Then these men said to the king, Be certain, O King, that by the law of the Medes and Persians no order or law which the king has put into force may be changed.
Then the king gave the order, and they took Daniel and put him into the lions' hole. The king made answer and said to Daniel, Your God, whose servant you are at all times, will keep you safe.
Then they got a stone and put it over the mouth of the hole, and it was stamped with the king's stamp and with the stamp of the lords, so that the decision about Daniel might not be changed.
Then the king went to his great house, and took no food that night, and no ... were placed before him, and his sleep went from him.
Then very early in the morning the king got up and went quickly to the lions' hole.
And when he came near the hole where Daniel was , he gave a loud cry of grief ; the king made answer and said to Daniel , O Daniel , servant of the living God , is your God , whose servant you are at all times , able
to keep you safe from the lions ?
Then Daniel said to the king, O King, have life for ever.
My God has sent his angel to keep the lions' mouths shut, and they have done me no damage: because I was seen to be without sin before him; and further, before you, O King, I have done no wrong.
Then the king was very glad, and gave orders for them to take Daniel up out of the hole. So Daniel was taken up out of the hole and he was seen to be untouched, because he had faith in his God.
And at the king ' s order , they took those men who had said evil against Daniel , and put them in the lions ' hole , with their wives and their children ; and they had not got to the floor of the hole before the lions overcame
them and all their bones were broken .
Then King Darius sent a letter to all the peoples, nations, and languages, living in all the earth: May your peace be increased.
It is my order that in all the kingdom of which I am ruler , men are to be shaking with fear before the God of Daniel : for he is the living God , unchanging for ever , and his kingdom is one which will never come to destruction
, his rule will go on to the end .
He gives salvation and makes men free from danger, and does signs and wonders in heaven and earth, who has kept Daniel safe from the power of the lions.
So this Daniel did well in the kingdom of Darius and in the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian.
In the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream, and visions came into his head on his bed: then he put the dream in writing.
I had a vision by night, and saw the four winds of heaven violently moving the great sea.
And four great beasts came up from the sea, different one from another.
The first was like a lion and had eagle ' s wings ; while I was watching its wings were pulled off , and it was lifted up from the earth and placed on two feet like a man , and a man ' s heart was given to it
And I saw another beast, like a bear, and it was lifted up on one side, and three side-bones were in its mouth, between its teeth: and they said to it, Up! take much flesh.
After this I saw another beast, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings like those of a bird; and the beast had four heads, and the power of a ruler was given to it.
After this , in my vision of the night , I saw a fourth beast , a thing causing fear and very troubling , full of power and very strong ; and it had great iron teeth : it took its food , crushing some of it to bits and
stamping down the rest with its feet : it was different from all the beasts before it ; and it had ten horns .
I was watching the horns with care , and I saw another coming up among them , a little one , before which three of the first horns were pulled up by the roots : and there were eyes like a man ' s eyes in this horn , and
a mouth saying great things .
I went on looking till the seats of kings were placed , and one like a very old man took his seat : his clothing was white as snow , and the hair of his head was like clean wool ; his seat was flames of fire and its wheels
burning fire .
A stream of fire was flowing and coming out from before him: a thousand thousands were his servants, and ten thousand times ten thousand were in their places before him: the judge was seated and the books were open.
Then I saw--because of the voice of the great words which the horn said--I saw till the beast was put to death, and its body was given to destruction, and the beast was given to the burning of fire.
As for the rest of the beasts, their authority was taken away: but they let them go on living for a measure of time.
I saw in visions of the night, and there was coming with the clouds of heaven one like a man, and he came to the one who was very old, and they took him near before him.
And to him was given authority and glory and a kingdom; and all peoples, nations, and languages were his servants: his authority is an eternal authority which will not come to an end, and his kingdom is one which will not come to destruction.
As for me, Daniel, my spirit was pained because of this, and the visions of my head were troubling me.
I came near to one of those who were waiting there, questioning him about what all this was. And he said to me that he would make clear to me the sense of these things.
These great beasts are four kings who will be cut off from the earth.
But the saints of the Most High will take the kingdom, and it will be theirs for ever, even for ever and ever.
Then it was my desire to have certain knowledge about the fourth beast , which was different from all the others , a cause of great fear , whose teeth were of iron and his nails of brass ; who took his food , crushing some of it to bits
and stamping on the rest with his feet ;
And about the ten horns on his head and the other which came up, causing the fall of three; that horn which had eyes, and a mouth saying great things, which seemed to be greater than the other horns.
And I saw how that horn made war on the saints and overcame them,
Till he came, who was very old, and the decision was made and the authority was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came when the saints took the kingdom.
This is what he said: The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom which will come on earth, different from all the kingdoms, and it will overcome all the earth, crushing it down and smashing it.
And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will come to power; and after them another will come up: he will be different from the first ones and will put down three kings.
And he will say words against the Most High , attempting to put an end to the saints of the Most High ; and he will have the idea of changing times and law ; and the saints will be given into his hands for a time and times and
half a time .
But the judge will be seated, and they will put an end to his authority, to overcome it and send complete destruction on it.
And the kingdom and the authority and the power of the kingdoms under all the heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and all powers will be his servants and do his pleasure.
Here is the end of the account. As for me, Daniel, I was greatly troubled by my thoughts, and the colour went from my face: but I kept the thing in my heart.
In the third year of the rule of Belshazzar the king, a vision was seen by me, Daniel, after the one I saw at first.
And I saw in the vision; and when I saw it, I was in the strong town Shushan, which is in the country of Elam; and in the vision I was by the water-door of the Ulai.
And lifting up my eyes, I saw, there before the stream, a male sheep with two horns: and the two horns were high, but one was higher than the other, the higher one coming up last.
I saw the sheep pushing to the west and to the north and to the south ; and no beasts were able to keep their place before him , and no one was able to get people out of his power ; but he did whatever his pleasure was and
made himself great .
And while I was giving thought to this, I saw a he-goat coming from the west over the face of all the earth without touching the earth: and the he-goat had a great horn between his eyes.
And he came to the two-horned sheep which I saw before the stream, rushing at him in the heat of his power.
And I saw him come right up to the sheep , and he was moved with wrath against him , attacking the sheep so that his two horns were broken ; and the sheep had not strength to keep his place before him , but was pushed down on the
earth and crushed under his feet : and there was no one to get the sheep out of his power .
And the he-goat became very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and in its place came up four other horns turned to the four winds of heaven.
And out of one of them came another horn, a little one, which became very great, stretching to the south and to the east and to the beautiful land.
And it became great, even as high as the army of heaven, pulling down some of the army, even of the stars, to the earth and crushing them under its feet.
It made itself great, even as great as the lord of the army; and by it the regular burned offering was taken away, and the place overturned and the holy place made waste.
... against the regular burned offering; and ... crushed down to the earth, and it did its pleasure and things went well for it.
Then there came to my ears the voice of a holy one talking ; and another holy one said to that certain one who was talking , How long will the vision be while the regular burned offering is taken away , and the unclean thing causing fear is put
up , and the holy place crushed under foot ?
And he said to him, For two thousand, three hundred evenings and mornings; then the holy place will be made clean.
And it came about that when I, Daniel, had seen this vision, I had a desire for the sense of it to be unfolded; and I saw one before me in the form of a man.
And the voice of a man came to my ears between the sides of the Ulai, crying out and saying, Gabriel, make the vision clear to this man.
So he came and took his place near where I was ; and when he came , I was full of fear and went down on my face : but he said to me , Let it be clear to you , O son of man ; for the vision
has to do with the time of the end .
Now while he was talking to me, I went into a deep sleep with my face to the earth: but touching me, he put me on my feet where I had been.
And he said, See, I will make clear to you what is to come in the later time of the wrath: for it has to do with the fixed time of the end.
The sheep which you saw with two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.
And the he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn between his eyes is the first king.
And as for that which was broken, in place of which four came up, four kingdoms will come up from his nation, but not with his power.
And in the later years of their kingdom, when their evil doings have become complete, there will come up a king full of pride and expert in dark sayings.
And his power will be great, and he will be purposing strange things. And all will go well for him and he will do his pleasure; and he will send destruction on the strong ones.
And his designs will be turned against the holy people , causing deceit to do well in his hand ; in his heart he will make himself great , and send destruction on numbers who are living unconscious of their danger ; and he will put himself up against the
prince of princes ; but he will be broken , though not by men ' s hands .
And the vision of evenings and mornings which has been talked of is true: and keep the vision secret; for it has to do with the far-off future.
And I, Daniel, was ill for some days; then I got up and did the king's business: and I was full of wonder at the vision, but no one was able to give the sense of it.
In the first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the kingdom of the Chaldaeans;
In the first year of his rule , I , Daniel , saw clearly from the books the number of years given by the word of the Lord to the prophet Jeremiah , in which the making waste of Jerusalem was to be complete , that is , seventy years
And turning my face to the Lord God, I gave myself up to prayer, requesting his grace, going without food, in haircloth and dust.
And I made prayer to the Lord my God, putting our sins before him, and said, O Lord, the great God, greatly to be feared. keeping your agreement and mercy with those who have love for you and do your orders;
We are sinners, acting wrongly and doing evil; we have gone against you, turning away from your orders and from your laws:
We have not given ear to your servants the prophets, who said words in your name to our kings and our rulers and our fathers and all the people of the land.
O Lord , righteousness is yours , but shame is on us , even to this day ; and on the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem , and on all Israel , those who are near and those who are far off , in all the countries
where you have sent them because of the sin which they have done against you .
O Lord, shame is on us, on our kings and our rulers and our fathers, because of our sin against you.
With the Lord our God are mercies and forgiveness, for we have gone against him;
And have not given ear to the voice of the Lord our God to go in the way of his laws which he put before us by the mouth of his servants the prophets.
And all Israel have been sinners against your law , turning away so as not to give ear to your voice : and the curse has been let loose on us , and the oath recorded in the law of Moses , the servant of God , for we have
done evil against him .
And he has given effect to his words which he said against us and against those who were our judges, by sending a great evil on us: for under all heaven there has not been done what has been done to Jerusalem.
As it was recorded in the law of Moses, all this evil has come on us: but we have made no prayer for grace from the Lord our God that we might be turned from our evil doings and come to true wisdom.
So the Lord has been watching over this evil and has made it come on us: for the Lord our God is upright in all his acts which he has done, and we have not given ear to his voice.
And now, O Lord our God, who took your people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand and made a great name for yourself even to this day; we are sinners, we have done evil.
O Lord , because of your righteousness , let your wrath and your passion be turned away from your town Jerusalem , your holy mountain : because , through our sins and the evil-doing of our fathers , Jerusalem and your people have become a cause of shame to all
who are round about us .
And now, give ear, O our God, to the prayer of your servant and to his request for grace, and let your face be shining on your holy place which is made waste, because of your servants, O Lord.
O my God , let your ear be turned and give hearing ; let your eyes be open and see how we have been made waste and the town which is named by your name : for we are not offering our prayers before you because of our righteousness ,
but because of your great mercies .
O Lord, give ear; O Lord, have forgiveness; O Lord, take note and do; let there be no more waiting; for the honour of your name, O my God, because your town and your people are named by your name.
And while I was still saying these words in prayer, and putting my sins and the sins of my people Israel before the Lord, and requesting grace from the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God;
Even while I was still in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at first when my weariness was great, put his hand on me about the time of the evening offering.
And teaching me and talking to me he said, O Daniel, I have come now to give you wisdom.
At the first word of your prayer a word went out, and I have come to give you knowledge; for you are a man dearly loved: so give thought to the word and let the vision be clear to you.
Seventy weeks have been fixed for your people and your holy town , to let wrongdoing be complete and sin come to its full limit , and for the clearing away of evil-doing and the coming in of eternal righteousness : so that the vision and the word of the
prophet may be stamped as true , and to put the holy oil on a most holy place .
Have then the certain knowledge that from the going out of the word for the building again of Jerusalem till the coming of a prince , on whom the holy oil has been put , will be seven weeks : in sixty-two weeks its building will be complete , with
square and earthwork .
And at the end of the times , even after the sixty-two weeks , one on whom the holy oil has been put will be cut off and have no . . . ; and the town and the holy place will be made waste together with a prince ;
and the end will come with an overflowing of waters , and even to the end there will be war ; the making waste which has been fixed .
And a strong order will be sent out against the great number for one week ; and so for half of the week the offering and the meal offering will come to an end ; and in its place will be an unclean thing causing fear ; till the destruction
which has been fixed is let loose on him who has made waste .
These are the words which Moses said to all Israel on the far side of Jordan, in the waste land in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran on the one side, and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab on the other.
It is eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea.
Now in the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses gave to the children of Israel all the orders which the Lord had given him for them;
After he had overcome Sihon, king of the Amorites, ruling in Heshbon, and Og, king of Bashan, ruling in Ashtaroth, at Edrei:
On the far side of Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses gave the people this law, saying,
The Lord our God said to us in Horeb, You have been long enough in this mountain:
Make a move now , and go on your way into the hill-country of the Amorites and the places near it , in the Arabah and the hill-country and in the lowlands and in the South and by the seaside , all the land of the Canaanites , and Lebanon
, as far as the great river , the river Euphrates .
See, all the land is before you: go in and take for yourselves the land which the Lord gave by an oath to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to their seed after them.
At that time I said to you, I am not able to undertake the care of you by myself;
The Lord your God has given you increase, and now you are like the stars of heaven in number.
May the Lord, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times greater in number than you are, and give you his blessing as he has said!
How is it possible for me by myself to be responsible for you, and undertake the weight of all your troubles and your arguments?
Take for yourselves men who are wise, far-seeing, and respected among you, from your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.
And you made answer and said to me, It is good for us to do as you say.
So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men and respected, and made them rulers over you, captains of thousands and captains of hundreds and captains of fifties and captains of tens, and overseers of your tribes.
And at that time I gave orders to your judges, saying, Let all questions between your brothers come before you for hearing, and give decisions uprightly between a man and his brother or one from another nation who is with him.
In judging , do not let a man ' s position have any weight with you ; give hearing equally to small and great ; have no fear of any man , for it is God who is judge : and any cause in which you are not able to
give a decision , you are to put before me and I will give it a hearing .
And at that time I gave you all the orders which you were to do.
Then we went on from Horeb, through all that great and cruel waste which you saw, on our way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as the Lord gave us orders; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.
And I said to you, You have come to the hill-country of the Amorites, which the Lord our God is giving us.
See now, the Lord your God has put the land into your hands: go up and take it, as the Lord, the God of your fathers, has said to you; have no fear and do not be troubled.
And you came near to me, every one of you, and said, Let us send men before us to go through the land with care and give us an account of the way we are to go and the towns to which we will come.
And what you said seemed good to me, and I took twelve men from among you, one from every tribe;
And they went up into the hill-country and came to the valley of Eshcol, and saw what was there.
And taking in their hands some of the fruit of the land, they came down again to us, and gave us their account, saying, It is a good land which the Lord our God is giving us.
But going against the order of the Lord your God, you would not go up:
And you made an angry outcry in your tents, and said, In his hate for us the Lord has taken us out of the land of Egypt, to give us up into the hands of the Amorites for our destruction.
Where are we going up ? Our brothers have made our hearts feeble with fear by saying , The people are greater and taller than we are , and the towns are great and walled up to heaven ; and more than this , we have seen the sons of
the Anakim there .
Then I said to you, Have no fear of them.
The Lord your God who goes before you will be fighting for you, and will do such wonders as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;
And in the waste land, where you have seen how the Lord was supporting you, as a man does his son, in all your journeying till you came to this place.
But for all this, you had no faith in the Lord your God,
Who goes before you on your way, looking for a place where you may put up your tents, in fire by night, lighting up the way you are to go, and in a cloud by day.
And the Lord, hearing your words, was angry, and said with an oath,
Truly, not one of this evil generation will see that good land which I said I would give to your fathers,
But only Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, he will see it; and to him and to his children I will give the land over which his feet have gone, because he has been true to the Lord with all his heart.
And, in addition, the Lord was angry with me because of you, saying, You yourself will not go into it:
Joshua, the son of Nun, your servant, he will go into the land: say to him that he is to be strong, for he will be Israel's guide into their heritage.
And your little ones, who, you said, would come into strange hands, your children, who now have no knowledge of good or evil, they will go into that land, and to them I will give it and it will be theirs.
But as for you, go back, journeying into the waste land by the way of the Red Sea.
Then you said to me, We have done evil against the Lord, we will go up to the attack, as the Lord our God has given us orders. And arming yourselves every one, you made ready to go up without care into the hill-country.
And the Lord said to me, Say to them, Do not go up to the attack; for I am not among you, and you will be overcome by those who are against you.
This I said to you, but you gave no attention and went against the orders of the Lord, and in your pride went up into the hill-country.
And the Amorites who were in the hill-country came out against you and put you to flight, rushing after you like bees, and overcame you in Seir, driving you even as far as Hormah.
And you came back, weeping before the Lord; but the Lord gave no attention to your cries and did not give ear to you.
So you were kept waiting in Kadesh for a long time.
At that time the Lord said to me, Make two other stones, cut like the first two, and come up to me on the mountain, and make an ark of wood.
And I will put on the stones the words which were on the first stones which were broken by you, and you are to put them into the ark.
So I made an ark of hard wood, and had two stones cut like the others, and went up the mountain with the stones in my hands.
And he put on the stones, as in the first writing, the ten rules which the Lord gave you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the great meeting: and the Lord gave the stones to me.
And turning round I came down from the mountain and put the stones in the ark which I had made; and there they are as the Lord gave me orders.
(And the children of Israel went on from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah: there death came to Aaron and he was put to rest in the earth; and Eleazar, his son, took his place as priest.
From there they went on to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of streams of water.
At that time the Lord had the tribe of Levi marked out to take up the ark of the Lord's agreement, to be before the Lord and to do his work and to give blessings in his name, to this day.
For this reason Levi has no part or heritage for himself among his brothers: the Lord is his heritage, as the Lord your God said to him.)
And I was in the mountain, as at the first time, for forty days and forty nights; and again the ears of the Lord were open to my prayer, and he did not send destruction on you.
Then the Lord said to me, Get up and go on your journey before the people, so that they may go in and take the land which I said in my oath to their fathers that I would give them.
And now, Israel, what would the Lord your God have you do, but to go in the fear of the Lord your God, walking in all his ways and loving him and doing his pleasure with all your heart and all your soul,
Doing the orders of the Lord and keeping his laws which I give you this day for your good?
The Lord your God is ruler of heaven, of the heaven of heavens, and of the earth with everything in it.
But the Lord had delight in your fathers and love for them, marking out for himself their seed after them, even you, from all peoples, as at this day.
Let your circumcision be of the heart, and put away your pride.
For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, strong in power and greatly to be feared, who has no respect for any man's position and takes no rewards:
Judging uprightly in the cause of the widow and of the child who has no father, and giving food and clothing in his mercy to the man from a strange country.
So be kind to the man from a strange country who is living among you, for you yourselves were living in a strange country in the land of Egypt.
Let the fear of the Lord your God be before you, give him worship and be true to him at all times, taking your oaths in his name.
He is your God, the God of your praise, your God who has done for you all these works of power which your eyes have seen.
Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons; and now the Lord your God has made you like the stars of heaven in number.
So have love for the Lord your God, and give him worship, and keep his laws and his decisions and his orders at all times.
And be certain in your minds this day; for these words are not said to your children, who have had no experience of the training of the Lord your God, and who have not seen his great power or his strong hand and his stretched-out arm,
Or his signs and wonders which he did in Egypt, to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and all his land;
And what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and their war-carriages; how he made the waters of the Red Sea come up over them when they went after you, and how the Lord put an end to them even to this day;
And what he did for you in the waste land, till you came to this place;
And what he did to Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab , the son of Reuben ; when they went down into the open mouth of the earth , with their families and their tents and every living thing which was theirs , before the eyes of all
Israel :
But your eyes have seen all the great works of the Lord which he has done.
So keep all the orders which I give you today, so that you may be strong, and go in and take the land which is to be your heritage;
And that your days may be long in the land which the Lord gave by an oath to your fathers and to their seed after them, a land flowing with milk and honey.
For the land where you are going is not like the land of Egypt from which you have come, where you put in your seeds, watering them with your foot, like a planted garden:
But the land where you are going is a land of hills and valleys, drinking in the rain of heaven:
A land cared for by the Lord your God: the eyes of the Lord your God are on it at all times from one end of the year to the other.
And it will be that if you truly give ear to the orders which I put before you this day, loving the Lord your God and worshipping him with all your heart and all your soul,
Then I will send rain on your land at the right time, the early rains and the late rains, so that you may get in your grain and your wine and your oil.
And I will give grass in your fields for your cattle, so that you may have food in full measure.
But take care that your hearts are not turned to false ways so that you become servants and worshippers of other gods;
For if you do so , the wrath of the Lord will be burning against you , and the heaven will be shut up so that there is no rain and the land will give no fruit ; and in a very little time you will be cut off from
the good land which the Lord is giving you .
So keep these words deep in your heart and in your soul, and have them fixed on your hand for a sign and marked on your brow;
Teaching them to your children, and talking of them when you are at rest in your house or walking by the way, when you go to sleep and when you get up:
Writing them on the pillars of your houses and over the doors of your towns:
So that your days, and the days of your children, may be long in the land which the Lord by his oath to your fathers said he would give them, like the days of the eternal heavens.
For if you take care to keep all the orders which I give you, and to do them; loving the Lord your God and walking in all his ways and being true to him:
Then the Lord will send these nations in flight before you, and you will take the lands of nations greater and stronger than yourselves.
Every place where you put your foot will be yours: from the waste land and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates as far as the Great Sea, will be the limits of your land.
All people will give way before you: for the Lord your God will put the fear of you on all the land through which you go, as he has said.
Today I put before you a blessing and a curse:
The blessing if you give ear to the orders of the Lord your God, which I give you this day:
And the curse if you do not give ear to the orders of the Lord your God, but let yourselves be turned from the way which I have put before you this day, and go after other gods which are not yours.
And when the Lord your God has taken you into the land of your heritage, you are to put the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.
Are they not on the other side of Jordan, looking west, in the land of the Canaanites living in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, by the holy tree of Moreh?
For you are about to go over Jordan to take the heritage which the Lord your God is giving you, and it will be your resting-place.
And you are to take care to keep all the laws and the decisions which I put before you today.
These are the laws and the decisions which you are to keep with care in the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers, has given you to be your heritage all the days of your life on earth.
You are to give up to the curse all those places where the nations, whom you are driving out, gave worship to their gods, on the high mountains and the hills and under every green tree:
Their altars and their pillars are to be broken down, and their holy trees burned with fire, and the images of their gods cut down; you are to take away their names out of that place.
Do not so to the Lord your God.
But let your hearts be turned to the place which will be marked out by the Lord your God, among your tribes, to put his name there;
And there you are to take your burned offerings and other offerings , and the tenth part of your goods , and the offerings to be lifted up to the Lord , and the offerings of your oaths , and those which you give freely from the impulse of your
hearts , and the first births among your herds and your flocks ;
There you and all your families are to make a feast before the Lord your God, with joy in everything to which you put your hand, because the Lord has given you his blessing.
You are not to do things then in the way in which we now do them here, every man as it seems right to him:
For you have not come to the rest and the heritage which the Lord your God is giving you.
But when you have gone over Jordan and are living in the land which the Lord your God is giving you as your heritage , and when he has given you rest from all those on every side who are fighting against you , and you are living there safely
Then there will be a place marked out by the Lord your God as the resting-place for his name , and there you will take all the things which I give you orders to take : your burned offerings and other offerings , and the tenth part of your goods
, and the offerings to be lifted up , and the offerings of your oaths which you make to the Lord ;
And you will be glad before the Lord your God, you and your sons and your daughters, and your men-servants and your women-servants, and the Levite who is with you in your house, because he has no part or heritage among you.
Take care that you do not make your burned offerings in any place you see:
But in the place marked out by the Lord in one of your tribes, there let your burned offerings be offered, and there do what I have given you orders to do.
Only you may put to death animals , such as the gazelle or the roe , for your food in any of your towns , at the desire of your soul , in keeping with the blessing of the Lord your God which he has given you : the unclean
and the clean may take of it .
But you may not take the blood for food, it is to be drained out on the earth like water.
In your towns you are not to take as food the tenth part of your grain , or of your wine or your oil , or the first births of your herds or of your flocks , or anything offered under an oath , or freely offered to the Lord
, or given as a lifted offering ;
But they will be your food before the Lord your God in the place of his selection , where you may make a feast of them , with your son and your daughter , and your man-servant and your woman-servant , and the Levite who is living with you :
and you will have joy before the Lord your God in everything to which you put your hand .
See that you do not give up caring for the Levite as long as you are living in your land.
When the Lord your God makes wide the limit of your land, as he has said, and you say, I will take flesh for my food, because you have a desire for it; then you may take whatever flesh you have a desire for.
If the place marked out by the Lord your God as the resting-place for his name is far away from you , then take from your herds and from your flocks which the Lord has given you , as I have said , and have a meal of it in
the towns where you may be living .
It will be your food, like the gazelle and the roe; the unclean and the clean may take of it.
But see that you do not take the blood for food; for the blood is the life; and you may not make use of the life as food with the flesh.
Do not take it for food but let it be drained out on the earth like water.
Do not take it for food; so that it may be well for you and for your children after you, while you do what is right in the eyes of the Lord.
But the holy things which you have, and the offerings of your oaths, you are to take to the place which will be marked out by the Lord:
Offering the flesh and the blood of your burned offerings on the altar of the Lord your God; and the blood of your offerings is to be drained out on the altar of the Lord your God, and the flesh will be your food.
Take note of all these orders I am giving you and give attention to them, so that it may be well for you and for your children after you for ever, while you do what is good and right in the eyes of the Lord your God.
When the people of the land where you are going have been cut off before you by the Lord your God, and you have taken their land and are living in it;
After their destruction take care that you do not go in their ways, and that you do not give thought to their gods, saying, How did these nations give worship to their gods? I will do as they did.
Do not so to the Lord your God: for everything which is disgusting to the Lord and hated by him they have done in honour of their gods: even burning their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods.
You are to keep with care all the words I give you, making no addition to them and taking nothing from them.
If ever you have among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and he gives you a sign or a wonder,
And the sign or the wonder takes place, and he says to you, Let us go after other gods, which are strange to you, and give them worship;
Then give no attention to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams: for the Lord your God is testing you, to see if all the love of your heart and soul is given to him.
But keep on in the ways of the Lord your God, fearing him and keeping his orders and hearing his voice, worshipping him and being true to him.
And that prophet or that dreamer of dreams is to be put to death ; for his words were said with the purpose of turning you away from the Lord your God , who took you out of the land of Egypt and made you free from the prison-house ;
and of forcing you out of the way in which the Lord your God has given you orders to go . So you are to put away the evil from among you .
If your brother , the son of your mother , or your son or your daughter or the wife of your heart , or the friend who is as dear to you as your life , working on you secretly says to you , Let us go and give worship
to other gods , strange to you and to your fathers ;
Gods of the peoples round about you, near or far, from one end of the earth to the other;
Do not be guided by him or give attention to him; have no pity on him or mercy, and give him no cover;
But put him to death without question; let your hand be the first stretched out against him to put him to death, and then the hands of all the people.
Let him be stoned with stones till he is dead; because it was his purpose to make you false to the Lord your God, who took you out of the land of Egypt, out of the prison-house.
And all Israel, hearing of it, will be full of fear, and no one will again do such evil as this among you.
And if word comes to you, in one of the towns which the Lord your God is giving you for your resting-place,
That good-for-nothing persons have gone out from among you, turning the people of their town from the right way and saying, Let us go and give worship to other gods, of whom you have no knowledge;
Then let a full search be made, and let questions be put with care; and if it is true and certain that such a disgusting thing has been done among you;
Then take up arms against the people of that town and give it up to the curse, with all its cattle and everything in it.
And take all the goods into the middle of its open space, burning the town and all its property with fire as an offering to the Lord your God; it is to be a waste for ever; there is to be no more building there.
Keep not a thing of what is cursed for yourselves: so the Lord may be turned away from the heat of his wrath, and have mercy on you, and give you increase as he said in his oath to your fathers:
So long as you give ear to the voice of the Lord your God, and keep all his orders which I give you today, and do what is right in the eyes of the Lord your God.
You are the children of the Lord your God: you are not to make cuts on your bodies or take off the hair on your brows in honour of the dead;
For you are a holy people to the Lord your God, and the Lord has taken you to be his special people out of all the nations on the face of the earth.
No disgusting thing may be your food.
These are the beasts which you may have for food: the ox, the sheep, and the goat;
The hart, the gazelle, and the roe, the mountain goat and the pygarg and the antelope and the mountain sheep.
Any beast which has a division in the horn of its foot and whose food comes back into its mouth to be crushed again, may be used for food.
But even among these , there are some which may not be used for food : such as the camel , the hare , and the coney , which are unclean to you , because , though their food comes back , the horn of their feet is not parted
in two .
And the pig is unclean to you, because though it has a division in the horn of its foot, its food does not come back; their flesh may not be used for food or their dead bodies touched by you.
And of the things living in the waters, you may take all those who have wings for swimming with and skins formed of thin plates.
But any which have no skin-plates or wings for swimming, you may not take; they are unclean for you.
All clean birds may be used for food.
But these birds you may not take: the eagle and the gier-eagle and the ospray;
The falcon and the kite, and birds of that sort;
Every raven, and all birds of that sort;
And the ostrich and the night-hawk and the sea-hawk and birds of that sort;
The little owl and the great owl and the water-hen;
And the pelican and the vulture and the cormorant;
The stork and the heron and birds of that sort, and the hoopoe and the bat.
Every winged thing which goes flat on the earth is unclean to you and may not be used as food.
But all clean birds you may take.
You may not have as food anything which has come to a natural death ; the man from another country who is living with you may take it for food , or you may get a price for it from one of another nation ; for you are a holy
people to the Lord your God . The young goat is not to be cooked in its mother ' s milk .
Put on one side a tenth of all the increase of your seed, produced year by year.
And make a feast before the Lord your God , in the place which is to be marked out , where his name will be for ever , of the tenth part of your grain and your wine and your oil , and the first births of your herds and
your flocks ; so that you may have the fear of the Lord your God in your hearts at all times .
And if the way is so long that you are not able to take these things to the place marked out by the Lord your God for his name, when he has given you his blessing, because it is far away from you;
Then let these things be exchanged for money, and, taking the money in your hand, go to the place marked out by the Lord your God for himself;
And with the money get whatever you have a desire for , oxen or sheep or wine or strong drink , whatever your soul ' s desire may be : and make a feast there before the Lord your God , and be glad , you and all your house
And give a thought to the Levite who is living among you, for he has no part or heritage in the land.
At the end of every three years take a tenth part of all your increase for that year, and put it in store inside your walls:
And the Levite , because he has no part or heritage in the land , and the man from a strange country , and the child who has no father , and the widow , who are living among you , will come and take food and have enough ;
and so the blessing of the Lord your God will be on you in everything you do .
At the end of every seven years there is to be a general forgiveness of debt.
This is how it is to be done : every creditor is to give up his right to whatever he has let his neighbour have ; he is not to make his neighbour , his countryman , give it back ; because a general forgiveness has been ordered by the
Lord .
A man of another nation may be forced to make payment of his debt, but if your brother has anything of yours, let it go;
But there will be no poor among you; for the Lord will certainly give you his blessing in the land which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage;
If only you give ear to the voice of the Lord your God, and take care to keep all these orders which I give you today.
For the Lord your God will give you his blessing as he has said : you will let other nations have the use of your money , but you will not make use of theirs ; you will be rulers over a number of nations , but they will not
be your rulers .
If in any of your towns in the land which the Lord your God is giving you, there is a poor man, one of your countrymen, do not let your heart be hard or your hand shut to him;
But let your hand be open to give him the use of whatever he is in need of.
And see that there is no evil thought in your heart , moving you to say to yourself , The seventh year , the year of forgiveness is near ; and so looking coldly on your poor countryman you give him nothing ; and he will make an outcry to
the Lord against you , and it will be judged as sin in you .
But it is right for you to give to him, without grief of heart: for because of this, the blessing of the Lord your God will be on all your work and on everything to which you put your hand.
For there will never be a time when there are no poor in the land; and so I give orders to you, Let your hand be open to your countrymen, to those who are poor and in need in your land.
If one of your countrymen, a Hebrew man or woman, becomes your servant for a price and does work for you six years, in the seventh year let him go free.
And when you make him free, do not let him go away with nothing in his hands:
But give him freely from your flock and from your grain and your wine: in the measure of the wealth which the Lord your God has given you, you are to give to him.
And keep in mind that you yourself were a servant in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God made you free: so I give you this order today.
But if he says to you, I have no desire to go away from you; because you and your family are dear to him and he is happy with you;
Then take a sharp-pointed instrument, driving it through his ear into the door, and he will be your servant for ever. And you may do the same for your servant-girl.
Let it not seem hard to you that you have to send him away free ; for he has been working for you for six years , which is twice the regular time for a servant : and the blessing of the Lord your God will be on you in
everything you do .
All the first males to come to birth in your herd and your flock are to be holy to the Lord your God: the first birth of your ox is not to be used for work, the wool of your first lamb is not to be cut.
But year by year you and all your house are to take a meal of it before the Lord, in the place of his selection.
But if it has any mark on it, if it is blind or has damaged legs, or if there is anything wrong with it, it may not be offered to the Lord your God.
It may be used for food in your houses: the unclean and the clean may take of it, as of the gazelle and the roe.
Only do not take its blood for food, but let it be drained out on the earth like water.
Take note of the month of Abib and keep the Passover to the Lord your God: for in the month of Abib the Lord your God took you out of Egypt by night.
The Passover offering, from your flock or your herd, is to be given to the Lord your God in the place marked out by him as the resting-place of his name.
Take no leavened bread with it ; for seven days let your food be unleavened bread , that is , the bread of sorrow ; for you came out of the land of Egypt quickly : so the memory of that day , when you came out of the land
of Egypt , will be with you all your life .
For seven days let no leaven be used through all your land; and nothing of the flesh which is put to death in the evening of the first day is to be kept through the night till morning.
The Passover offering is not to be put to death in any of the towns which the Lord your God gives you:
But in the place marked out by the Lord your God as the resting-place of his name, there you are to put the Passover to death in the evening, at sundown, at that time of the year when you came out of Egypt.
It is to be cooked and taken as food in the place marked out by the Lord: and in the morning you are to go back to your tents.
For six days let your food be unleavened bread; and on the seventh day there is to be a holy meeting to the Lord your God; no work is to be done.
Let seven weeks be numbered from the first day when the grain is cut.
Then keep the feast of weeks to the Lord your God, with an offering freely given to him from the wealth he has given you:
Then you are to be glad before the Lord your God , you and your son and your daughter , your man-servant and your woman-servant , and the Levite who is with you , and the man from a strange country , and the child without a father , and
the widow , who are living among you , in the place marked out by the Lord your God as a resting-place for his name .
And you will keep in mind that you were a servant in the land of Egypt: and you will take care to keep all these laws.
You are to keep the feast of tents for seven days after you have got in all your grain and made your wine:
You are to keep the feast with joy , you and your son and your daughter , your man-servant and your woman-servant , and the Levite , and the man from a strange country , and the child without a father , and the widow , who are living among
you .
Keep the feast to the Lord your God for seven days , in the place marked out by the Lord : because the blessing of the Lord your God will be on all the produce of your land and all the work of your hands , and you will have
nothing but joy .
Three times in the year let all your males come before the Lord your God in the place named by him ; at the feast of unleavened bread , the feast of weeks , and the feast of tents : and they are not to come before the Lord with
nothing in their hands ;
Every man is to give as he is able, in the measure of the blessing which the Lord your God has given you.
You are to make judges and overseers in all your towns which the Lord your God gives you, for every tribe: and they are to be upright men, judging the people in righteousness.
You are not to be moved in your judging by a man's position, you are not to take rewards; for rewards make the eyes of the wise man blind, and the decisions of the upright false.
Let righteousness be your guide, so that you may have life, and take for your heritage the land which the Lord your God is giving you.
Let no holy tree of any sort be planted by the altar of the Lord your God which you will make.
You are not to put up stone pillars, for they are hated by the Lord your God.
No ox or sheep which has a mark on it or is damaged in any way may be offered to the Lord your God: for that is disgusting to the Lord your God.
If there is any man or woman among you, in any of the towns which the Lord your God gives you, who does evil in the eyes of the Lord your God, sinning against his agreement,
By becoming a servant of other gods and worshipping them or the sun or the moon or all the stars of heaven, against my orders;
If word of this comes to your ears, then let this thing be looked into with care, and if there is no doubt that it is true, and such evil has been done in Israel;
Then you are to take the man or woman who has done the evil to the public place of your town, and they are to be stoned with stones till they are dead.
On the word of two or three witnesses, a man may be given the punishment of death; but he is not to be put to death on the word of one witness.
The hands of the witnesses will be the first to put him to death, and after them the hands of all the people. So you are to put away the evil from among you.
If you are not able to give a decision as to who is responsible for a death , or who is right in a cause , or who gave the first blow in a fight , and there is a division of opinion about it in your town : then
go to the place marked out by the Lord your God ;
And come before the priests, the Levites, or before him who is judge at the time: and they will go into the question and give you a decision:
And you are to be guided by the decision they give in the place named by the Lord, and do whatever they say:
Acting in agreement with their teaching and the decision they give: not turning to one side or the other from the word they have given you.
And any man who, in his pride, will not give ear to the priest whose place is there before the Lord your God, or to the judge, is to be put to death: you are to put away the evil from Israel.
And all the people, hearing of it, will be full of fear and put away their pride.
When you have come into the land which the Lord your God is giving you, and have taken it for a heritage and are living in it, if it is your desire to have a king over you, like the other nations round about you;
Then see that you take as your king the man named by the Lord your God: let your king be one of your countrymen, not a man of another nation who is not one of yourselves.
And he is not to get together a great army of horses for himself, or make the people go back to Egypt to get horses for him: because the Lord has said, You will never again go back that way.
And he is not to have a great number of wives, for fear that his heart may be turned away; or great wealth of silver and gold.
And when he has taken his place on the seat of his kingdom, he is to make in a book a copy of this law, from that which the priests, the Levites, have in their care:
And it is to be with him for his reading all the days of his life, so that he may be trained in the fear of the Lord his God to keep and do all the words of this teaching and these laws:
So that his heart may not be lifted up over his countrymen, and he may not be turned away from the orders, to one side or the other: but that his life and the lives of his children may be long in his kingdom in Israel.
The priests, the Levites, that is, all the tribe of Levi, will have no part or heritage with Israel: their food and their heritage will be the offerings of the Lord made by fire.
And they will have no heritage among their countrymen: the Lord is their heritage, as he has said to them.
And this is to be the priests' right: those who make an offering of a sheep or an ox are to give to the priest the top part of the leg and the two sides of the head and the stomach.
And in addition you are to give him the first of your grain and wine and oil, and the first wool cut from your sheep.
For he, and his sons after him for ever, have been marked out by the Lord your God from all your tribes, to do the work of priests in the name of the Lord.
And if a Levite, moved by a strong desire, comes from any town in all Israel where he is living to the place marked out by the Lord;
Then he will do the work of a priest in the name of the Lord his God, with all his brothers the Levites who are there before the Lord.
His food will be the same as theirs, in addition to what has come to him as the price of his property.
When you have come into the land which the Lord your God is giving you, do not take as your example the disgusting ways of those nations.
Let there not be seen among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter go through the fire, or anyone using secret arts, or a maker of strange sounds, or a reader of signs, or any wonder-worker,
Or anyone using secret force on people, or putting questions to a spirit, or having secret knowledge, or going to the dead for directions.
For all who do such things are disgusting to the Lord; and because of these disgusting things the Lord your God is driving them out before you.
You are to be upright in heart before the Lord your God.
For these nations, whose land you are taking, give attention to readers of signs and to those using secret arts: but the Lord your God will not let you do so.
The Lord your God will give you a prophet from among your people, like me; you will give ear to him;
In answer to the request you made to the Lord your God in Horeb on the day of the great meeting , when you said , Let not the voice of the Lord my God come to my ears again , and let me not see this great fire any
more , or death will overtake me .
Then the Lord said to me, What they have said is well said.
I will give them a prophet from among themselves, like you, and I will put my words in his mouth, and he will say to them whatever I give him orders to say.
And whoever does not give ear to my words which he will say in my name, will be responsible to me.
But the prophet who takes it on himself to say words in my name which I have not given him orders to say, or who says anything in the name of other gods, will come to his death.
And if you say in your hearts, How are we to be certain that the word does not come from the Lord?
When a prophet makes a statement in the name of the Lord , if what he says does not take place and his words do not come true , then his word is not the word of the Lord : the words of the prophet were said in the pride
of his heart , and you are to have no fear of him .
When the nations, whose land the Lord your God is giving you, have been cut off by him, and you have taken their place and are living in their towns and in their houses;
You are to have three towns marked out in the land which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage.
You are to make ready a way, and see that the land which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage, is marked out into three parts, to which any taker of life may go in flight.
This is to be the rule for anyone who goes in flight there, after causing the death of his neighbour in error and not through hate;
For example , if a man goes into the woods with his neighbour for the purpose of cutting down trees , and when he takes his axe to give a blow to the tree , the head of the axe comes off , and falling on to his neighbour gives
him a wound causing his death ; then the man may go in flight to one of these towns and be safe :
For if not , he who has the right of punishment may go running after the taker of life in the heat of his wrath , and overtake him because the way is long , and give him a death-blow ; though it is not right for him to be
put to death because he was not moved by hate .
And so I am ordering you to see that three towns are marked out for this purpose.
And if the Lord your God makes wide the limits of your land, as he said in his oath to your fathers, and gives you all the land which he undertook to give to your fathers;
If you keep and do all these orders which I give you today, loving the Lord your God and walking ever in his ways; then let three more towns, in addition to these three, be marked out for you:
So that in all your land, which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage, no man may be wrongly put to death, for which you will be responsible.
But if any man has hate for his neighbour, and waiting for him secretly makes an attack on him and gives him a blow causing his death, and then goes in flight to one of these towns;
The responsible men of his town are to send and take him, and give him up to the one who has the right of punishment to be put to death.
Have no pity on him, so that Israel may be clear from the crime of putting a man to death without cause, and it will be well for you.
Your neighbour's landmark, which was put in its place by the men of old times, is not to be moved or taken away in the land of your heritage which the Lord your God is giving you.
One witness may not make a statement against a man in relation to any sin or wrongdoing which he has done: on the word of two or three witnesses a question is to be judged.
If a false witness makes a statement against a man, saying that he has done wrong,
Then the two men, between whom the argument has taken place, are to come before the Lord, before the priests and judges who are then in power;
And the judges will have the question looked into with care: and if the witness is seen to be false and to have made a false statement against his brother,
Then do to him what it was his purpose to do to his brother: and so put away the evil from among you.
And the rest of the people, hearing of it, will be full of fear, and never again do such evil among you.
Have no pity; let life be given for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
Then we went back, journeying into the waste land by the way to the Red Sea, as the Lord had said to me: and we were a long time going round Mount Seir.
And the Lord said to me,
You have been journeying round this mountain long enough: now go to the north;
And give the people orders, saying, You are about to go through the land of your brothers, the children of Esau, who are living in Seir; and they will have fear of you; so take care what you do:
Make no attack on them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even space enough for a man's foot: because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for his heritage.
You may get food for your needs from them for a price, and water for drinking.
For the blessing of the Lord your God has been on you in all the work of your hands : he has knowledge of your wanderings through this great waste : these forty years the Lord your God has been with you , and you have been short of nothing
So we went on past our brothers, the children of Esau, living in Seir, by the road through the Arabah, from Elath and Ezion-geber. And turning, we went by the road through the waste land of Moab.
And the Lord said to me, Make no attack on Moab and do not go to war with them, for I will not give you any of his land: because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for their heritage.
(In the past the Emim were living there; a great people, equal in numbers to the Anakim and as tall;
They are numbered among the Rephaim, like the Anakim; but are named Emim by the Moabites.
And the Horites in earlier times were living in Seir, but the children of Esau took their place; they sent destruction on them and took their land for themselves, as Israel did to the land of his heritage which the Lord gave them.)
Get up now, and go over the stream Zered. So we went over the stream Zered.
Thirty-eight years had gone by from the time when we came away from Kadesh-barnea till we went over the stream Zered; by that time all the generation of the men of war among us were dead, as the Lord had said.
For the hand of the Lord was against them, working their destruction, till all were dead.
So when death had overtaken all the men of war among the people,
The word of the Lord came to me, saying,
You are about to go by Ar, the limit of the country of Moab;
And when you come near the land of the children of Ammon , give them no cause of trouble and do not make war on them , for I will not give you any of the land of the children of Ammon for your heritage : because I have given
it to the children of Lot .
(That land is said to have been a land of the Rephaim, for Rephaim had been living there in earlier times, but they were named Zamzummim by the Ammonites;
They were a great people, tall as the Anakim, and equal to them in number; but the Lord sent destruction on them and the children of Ammon took their place, living in their land;
As he did for the children of Esau living in Seir, when he sent destruction on the Horites before them, and they took their land where they are living to this day:
And the Avvim, living in the small towns as far as Gaza, came to destruction by the hands of the Caphtorim who came out from Caphtor and took their land.)
Get up now , and go on your journey , crossing over the valley of the Arnon : see , I have given into your hands Sihon , the Amorite , king of Heshbon , and all his land : go forward to make it yours , and make war
on him ,
From now on I will put the fear of you in all peoples under heaven, who, hearing of you, will be shaking with fear and grief of heart because of you.
Then from the waste land of Kedemoth I sent representatives to Sihon, king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,
Let me go through your land: I will keep to the highway, not turning to the right or to the left;
Let me have food, at a price, for my needs, and water for drinking: only let me go through on foot;
As the children of Esau did for me in Seir and the Moabites in Ar; till I have gone over Jordan into the land which the Lord our God is giving us.
But Sihon, king of Heshbon, would not let us go through; for the Lord your God made his spirit hard and his heart strong, so that he might give him up into your hands as at this day.
And the Lord said to me, See, from now on I have given Sihon and his land into your hands: go forward now to take his land and make it yours.
Then Sihon came out against us with all his people, to make an attack on us at Jahaz.
And the Lord our God gave him into our hands; and we overcame him and his sons and all his people.
At that time we took all his towns, and gave them over to complete destruction, together with men, women, and children; we had no mercy on any:
Only the cattle we took for ourselves, with the goods from the towns we had taken.
From Aroer on the edge of the valley of the Arnon and from the town in the valley as far as Gilead, no town was strong enough to keep us out; the Lord our God gave them all into our hands:
But you did not go near the land of the children of Ammon, that is, all the side of the river Jabbok or the towns of the hill-country, wherever the Lord our God had said we were not to go.
When you go out to war against other nations , and come face to face with horses and war-carriages and armies greater in number than yourselves , have no fear of them : for the Lord your God is with you , who took you up out of the land
of Egypt .
And when you are on the point of attacking, let the priest come forward and say to the people,
Give ear, O Israel: today you are going forward to the fight; let your heart be strong; do not let uncontrolled fear overcome you because of those who are against you;
For the Lord your God goes with you, fighting for you to give you salvation from those who are against you.
And let the overseers say to the people , If there is any man who has made for himself a new house and has not gone into it , let him go back to his house , so that in the event of his death in the fight , another
may not take his house for himself .
Or if any man has made a vine-garden without taking the first-fruits of it, let him go back to his house, so that in the event of his death in the fight, another may not be the first to make use of the fruit.
Or if any man is newly married and has had no sex relations with his wife, let him go back to his house, so that in the event of his death in the fight, another man may not take her.
And let the overseers go on to say to the people, If there is any man whose heart is feeble with fear, let him go back to his house before he makes the hearts of his countrymen feeble.
Then, after saying these words to the people, let the overseers put captains over the army.
When you come to a town, before attacking it, make an offer of peace.
And if it gives you back an answer of peace, opening its doors to you, then all the people in it may be put to forced work as your servants.
If however it will not make peace with you, but war, then let it be shut in on all sides:
And when the Lord your God has given it into your hands, let every male in it be put to death without mercy.
But the women and the children and the cattle and everything in the town and all its wealth, you may take for yourselves: the wealth of your haters, which the Lord your God has given you, will be your food.
So you are to do to all the towns far away, which are not the towns of these nations.
But in the towns of these peoples whose land the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage, let no living thing be kept from death:
Give them up to the curse; the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, as the Lord your God has given you orders:
So that you may not take them as your example and do all the disgusting things which they do in the worship of their gods, so sinning against the Lord your God.
If in war a town is shut in by your armies for a long time , do not let its trees be cut down and made waste ; for their fruit will be your food ; are the trees of the countryside men for you to take up arms against
them ?
Only those trees which you are certain are not used for food may be cut down and put to destruction: and you are to make walls of attack against the town till it is taken.
If, in the land which the Lord your God is giving you, you come across the dead body of a man in the open country, and you have no idea who has put him to death:
Then your responsible men and your judges are to come out, and give orders for the distance from the dead body to the towns round about it to be measured;
And whichever town is nearest to the body, the responsible men of that town are to take from the herd a young cow which has never been used for work or put under the yoke;
And they are to take the cow into a valley where there is flowing water, and which is not ploughed or planted, and there the neck of the cow is to be broken:
Then the priests , the sons of Levi , are to come near ; for they have been marked out by the Lord your God to be his servants and to give blessings in the name of the Lord ; and by their decision every argument and every blow is
to be judged :
And all the responsible men of that town which is nearest to the dead man, washing their hands over the cow whose neck was broken in the valley,
Will say, This death is not the work of our hands and our eyes have not seen it.
Have mercy, O Lord, on your people Israel whom you have made free, and take away from your people the crime of a death without cause. Then they will no longer be responsible for the man's death.
So you will take away the crime of a death without cause from among you, when you do what is right in the eyes of the Lord.
When you go out to war against other nations, and the Lord your God gives them up into your hands and you take them as prisoners;
If among the prisoners you see a beautiful woman and it is your desire to make her your wife;
Then take her back to your house; and let her hair and her nails be cut;
And let her take off the dress in which she was made prisoner and go on living in your house and weeping for her father and mother for a full month : and after that you may go in to her and be her husband and she will be your
wife .
But if you have no delight in her, you are to let her go wherever she will; you may not take a price for her as if she was your property, for you have made use of her for your pleasure.
If a man has two wives, one greatly loved and the other hated, and the two of them have had children by him; and if the first son is the child of the hated wife:
Then when he gives his property to his sons for their heritage, he is not to put the son of his loved one in the place of the first son, the son of the hated wife:
But he is to give his first son his birthright, and twice as great a part of his property: for he is the first-fruits of his strength and the right of the first son is his.
If a man has a son who is hard-hearted and uncontrolled, who gives no attention to the voice of his father and mother, and will not be ruled by them, though they give him punishment:
Then let his father and mother take him to the responsible men of the town, to the public place;
And say to them, This son of ours is hard-hearted and uncontrolled, he will not give attention to us; he gives himself up to pleasure and strong drink.
Then he is to be stoned to death by all the men of the town: so you are to put away the evil from among you; and all Israel, hearing of it, will be full of fear.
If a man does a crime for which the punishment is death, and he is put to death by hanging him on a tree;
Do not let his body be on the tree all night , but put it to rest in the earth the same day ; for the man who undergoes hanging is cursed by God ; so do not make unclean the land which the Lord your God is giving you
for your heritage .
If you see your brother's ox or his sheep wandering, do not go by without helping, but take them back to your brother.
If their owner is not near, or if you are not certain who he is, then take the beast to your house and keep it till its owner comes in search of it, and then you are to give it back to him.
Do the same with his ass or his robe or anything which has gone from your brother's keeping and which you have come across: do not keep it to yourself.
If you see your brother's ox or his ass falling down on the road, do not go by without giving him help in lifting it up again.
It is not right for a woman to be dressed in man's clothing, or for a man to put on a woman's robe: whoever does such things is disgusting to the Lord your God.
If by chance you see a place which a bird has made for itself in a tree or on the earth , with young ones or eggs , and the mother bird seated on the young ones or on the eggs , do not take the mother bird with the
young :
See that you let the mother bird go, but the young ones you may take; so it will be well for you and your life will be long.
If you are building a house, make a railing for the roof, so that the blood of any man falling from it will not come on your house.
Do not have your vine-garden planted with two sorts of seed: or all of it may become a loss, the seed you have put in as well as the increase.
Do not do your ploughing with an ox and an ass yoked together.
Do not have clothing made of two sorts of thread, wool and linen together.
On the four edges of your robe, with which your body is covered, put ornaments of twisted threads.
If any man takes a wife, and having had connection with her, has no delight in her,
And says evil things about her and gives her a bad name, saying, I took this woman, and when I had connection with her it was clear to me that she was not a virgin:
Then let the girl's father and mother put before the responsible men of the town, in the public place, signs that the girl was a virgin:
And let the girl's father say to the responsible men, I gave my daughter to this man for his wife, but he has no love for her;
And now he has put shame on her, saying that she is not a virgin; but here is the sign that she is a virgin. Then they are to put her clothing before the responsible men of the town.
Then the responsible men of the town are to give the man his punishment;
They will take from him a hundred shekels of silver , which are to be given to the father of the girl , because he has given an evil name to a virgin of Israel : she will go on being his wife , he may never put her away
all his life .
But if what he has said is true, and she is seen to be not a virgin,
Then they are to make the girl come to the door of her father ' s house and she will be stoned to death by the men of the town , because she has done evil and put shame on Israel , by acting as a loose woman in her
father ' s house : so you are to put away evil from among you .
If a man is taken in the act of going in to a married woman, the two of them, the man as well as the woman, are to be put to death: so you are to put away the evil from Israel.
If a young virgin has given her word to be married to a man, and another man meeting her in the town, has connection with her;
Then you are to take the two of them to the doorway of the town , and have them stoned to death ; the young virgin , because she gave no cry for help , though it was in the town , and the man , because he has put
shame on his neighbour ' s wife : so you are to put away evil from among you .
But if the man, meeting such a virgin in the open country, takes her by force, then only the man is to be put to death;
Nothing is to be done to the virgin, because there is no cause of death in her: it is the same as if a man made an attack on his neighbour and put him to death:
For he came across her in the open country, and there was no one to come to the help of the virgin in answer to her cry.
If a man sees a young virgin, who has not given her word to be married to anyone, and he takes her by force and has connection with her, and discovery is made of it;
Then the man will have to give the virgin's father fifty shekels of silver and make her his wife, because he has put shame on her; he may never put her away all his life.
A man may not take his father's wife or have sex relations with a woman who is his father's.
No man whose private parts have been wounded or cut off may come into the meeting of the Lord's people.
One whose father and mother are not married may not come into the meeting of the Lord's people, or any of his family to the tenth generation.
No Ammonite or Moabite or any of their people to the tenth generation may come into the meeting of the Lord's people:
Because they gave you no bread or water on your way, when you came out of Egypt: and they got Balaam, the son of Peor, from Pethor in Aram-naharaim to put curses on you.
But the Lord your God would not give ear to Balaam, but let the curse be changed into a blessing to you, because of his love for you.
Do nothing for their peace or well-being for ever.
But have no hate for an Edomite, because he is your brother, or for an Egyptian, for you were living in his land.
Their children in the third generation may come into the meeting of the Lord's people.
When you go out to war and put your tents in position, keep from every evil thing.
If any man among you becomes unclean through anything which has taken place in the night, he is to go out from the tent-circle and keep outside it:
But when evening comes near, let him take a bath: and after sundown he may come back to the tents.
Let there be a place outside the tent-circle to which you may go;
And have among your arms a spade; and when you have been to that place, let that which comes from you be covered up with earth:
For the Lord your God is walking among your tents , to keep you safe and to give up into your hands those who are fighting against you ; then let your tents be holy , so that he may see no unclean thing among you , and be turned
away from you .
Do not give back to his master a servant who has gone in flight from his master and come to you:
Let him go on living among you in whatever place is most pleasing to him: do not be hard on him.
No daughter of Israel is to let herself be used as a loose woman for a strange god, and no son of Israel is to give himself to a man.
Do not take into the house of the Lord your God , as an offering for an oath , the price of a loose woman or the money given to one used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods : for these two things are disgusting to the
Lord your God .
Do not take interest from an Israelite on anything, money or food or any other goods, which you let him have:
From men of other nations you may take interest, but not from an Israelite: so that the blessing of the Lord your God may be on everything to which you put your hand, in the land which you are about to take as your heritage.
When you take an oath to the Lord, do not be slow to give effect to it: for without doubt the Lord your God will make you responsible, and will put it to your account as sin.
But if you take no oath, there will be no sin.
Whatever your lips have said, see that you do it; for you gave your word freely to the Lord your God.
When you go into your neighbour's vine-garden, you may take of his grapes at your pleasure, but you may not take them away in your vessel.
When you go into your neighbour's field, you may take the heads of grain with your hand; but you may not put your blade to his grain.
If a man takes a wife, and after they are married she is unpleasing to him because of some bad quality in her, let him give her a statement in writing and send her away from his house.
And when she has gone away from him, she may become another man's wife.
And if the second husband has no love for her and, giving her a statement in writing, sends her away; or if death comes to the second husband to whom she was married;
Her first husband , who had sent her away , may not take her back after she has been wife to another ; for that is disgusting to the Lord : and you are not to be a cause of sin in the land which the Lord your God is
giving you for your heritage .
A newly married man will not have to go out with the army or undertake any business, but may be free for one year, living in his house for the comfort of his wife.
No one is to take, on account of a debt, the stones with which grain is crushed: for in doing so he takes a man's living.
If a man takes by force one of his countrymen, the children of Israel, using him as his property or getting a price for him, that thief is to be put to death: so you are to put away evil from among you.
In connection with the leper's disease, take care to keep and do every detail of the teaching of the priests, the Levites: as I gave them orders, so you are to do.
Keep in mind what the Lord your God did to Miriam on the way, when you came out of Egypt.
If you let your brother have the use of anything which is yours, do not go into his house and take anything of his as a sign of his debt;
But keep outside till he comes out and gives it to you.
If he is a poor man, do not keep his property all night;
But be certain to give it back to him when the sun goes down, so that he may have his clothing for sleeping in, and will give you his blessing: and this will be put to your account as righteousness before the Lord your God.
Do not be hard on a servant who is poor and in need, if he is one of your countrymen or a man from another nation living with you in your land.
Give him his payment day by day, not keeping it back over night; for he is poor and his living is dependent on it; and if his cry against you comes to the ears of the Lord, it will be judged as sin in you.
Fathers are not to be put to death for their children or children for their fathers: every man is to be put to death for the sin which he himself has done.
Be upright in judging the cause of the man from a strange country and of him who has no father; do not take a widow's clothing on account of a debt:
But keep in mind that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God made you free: for this is why I give you orders to do this.
When you get in the grain from your field , if some of the grain has been dropped by chance in the field , do not go back and get it , but let it be for the man from a strange land , the child without a father ,
and the widow : so that the blessing of the Lord your God may be on all the work of your hands .
When you are shaking the fruit from your olive-trees, do not go over the branches a second time: let some be for the man from a strange land, the child without a father, and the widow.
When you are pulling the grapes from your vines, do not take up those which have been dropped; let them be for the man from a strange land, the child without a father, and the widow.
Keep in mind that you were a servant in the land of Egypt: for this is why I give you orders to do this.
If there is an argument between men and they go to law with one another, let the judges give their decision for the upright, and against the wrongdoer.
And if the wrongdoer is to undergo punishment by whipping, the judge will give orders for him to go down on his face and be whipped before him, the number of the blows being in relation to his crime.
He may be given forty blows, not more; for if more are given, your brother may be shamed before you.
Do not keep the ox from taking the grain when he is crushing it.
If brothers are living together and one of them , at his death , has no son , the wife of the dead man is not to be married outside the family to another man : let her husband ' s brother go in to her and make her his
wife , doing as it is right for a brother-in-law to do .
Then the first male child she has will take the rights of the brother who is dead, so that his name may not come to an end in Israel.
But if the man says he will not take his brother ' s wife , then let the wife go to the responsible men of the town , and say , My husband ' s brother will not keep his brother ' s name living in Israel ; he will
not do what it is right for a husband ' s brother to do .
Then the responsible men of the town will send for the man, and have talk with him: and if he still says, I will not take her;
Then his brother ' s wife is to come to him , before the responsible men of the town , and take his shoe off his foot , and put shame on him , and say , So let it be done to the man who will not take care
of his brother ' s name .
And his family will be named in Israel, The house of him whose shoe has been taken off.
If two men are fighting, and the wife of one of them, coming to the help of her husband, takes the other by the private parts;
Her hand is to be cut off; have no pity on her.
Do not have in your bag different weights, a great and a small;
Or in your house different measures, a great and a small.
But have a true weight and a true measure: so that your life may be long in the land which the Lord your God is giving you.
For all who do such things, and all whose ways are not upright, are disgusting to the Lord your God.
Keep in mind what Amalek did to you on your way from Egypt;
How, meeting you on the way, he made an attack on you when you were tired and without strength, cutting off all the feeble ones at the end of your line; and the fear of God was not in him.
So when the Lord your God has given you rest from all who are against you on every side , in the land which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage , see to it that the memory of Amalek is cut off from the earth ;
keep this in mind .
Now when you have come into the land which the Lord is giving you for your heritage, and you have made it yours and are living in it;
You are to take a part of the first-fruits of the earth , which you get from the land which the Lord your God is giving you , and put it in a basket , and go to the place marked out by the Lord your God , as the
resting-place of his name .
And you are to come to him who is priest at that time, and say to him, I give witness today before the Lord your God, that I have come into the land which the Lord made an oath to our fathers to give us.
Then the priest will take the basket from your hand and put it down in front of the altar of the Lord your God.
And these are the words which you will say before the Lord your God: My father was a wandering Aramaean, and he went down with a small number of people into Egypt; there he became a great and strong nation:
And the Egyptians were cruel to us, crushing us under a hard yoke:
And our cry went up to the Lord, the God of our fathers, and the Lord's ear was open to the voice of our cry, and his eyes took note of our grief and the crushing weight of our work:
And the Lord took us out of Egypt with a strong hand and a stretched-out arm, with works of power and signs and wonders:
And he has been our guide to this place, and has given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
So now, I have come here with the first of the fruits of the earth which you, O Lord, have given me. Then you will put it down before the Lord your God and give him worship:
And you will have joy in every good thing which the Lord your God has given to you and to your family; and the Levite, and the man from a strange land who is with you, will take part in your joy.
When you have taken out a tenth from the tenth of all your produce in the third year , which is the year when this has to be done , give it to the Levite , and the man from a strange land , and the child without a father
, and the widow , so that they may have food in your towns and be full ;
And say before the Lord your God , I have taken all the holy things out of my house and have given them to the Levite , and the man from a strange land , and him who has no father , and the widow , as you have given
me orders : I have kept in mind all your orders , in nothing have I gone against them :
No part of these things has been used for food in a time of weeping , or put away when I was unclean , or given for the dead : I have given ear to the voice of the Lord my God , and have done all you have given
me orders to do .
So, looking down from your holy place in heaven, send your blessing on your people Israel and on the land which you have given us, as you said in your oath to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.
Today the Lord your God gives you orders to keep all these laws and decisions: so then keep and do them with all your heart and all your soul.
Today you have given witness that the Lord is your God, and that you will go in his ways and keep his laws and his orders and his decisions and give ear to his voice:
And the Lord has made it clear this day that you are a special people to him, as he gave you his word; and that you are to keep all his orders;
And that he will make you high over all the nations he has made, in praise, in name, and in honour, and that you are to be a holy people to the Lord your God as he has said.
Then Moses and the responsible men of Israel gave the people these orders: Keep all the orders which I have given you this day;
And on the day when you go over Jordan into the land which the Lord your God is giving you, put up great stones, coating them with building-paste,
And writing on them all the words of this law , after you have gone over ; so that you may take the heritage which the Lord your God is giving you , a land flowing with milk and honey , as the Lord , the God of your fathers
, has said .
And when you have gone over Jordan, you are to put up these stones, as I have said to you today, in Mount Ebal, and have them coated with building-paste.
There you are to make an altar to the Lord your God, of stones on which no iron instrument has been used.
You are to make the altar of the Lord your God of uncut stones; offering on it burned offerings to the Lord your God:
And you are to make your peace-offerings, feasting there with joy before the Lord your God.
And put on the stones all the words of this law, writing them very clearly.
Then Moses and the priests, the Levites, said to all Israel, Be quiet and give ear, O Israel; today you have become the people of the Lord your God.
For this cause you are to give ear to the voice of the Lord your God, and do his orders and his laws which I give you this day.
That same day Moses said to the people,
These are to take their places on Mount Gerizim for blessing the people when you have gone over Jordan: Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Joseph and Benjamin;
And these are to be on Mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
Then the Levites are to say in a loud voice to all the men of Israel,
Cursed is the man who makes any image of wood or stone or metal, disgusting to the Lord, the work of man's hands, and puts it up in secret. And let all the people say, So be it.
Cursed is he who does not give honour to his father or mother. And let all the people say, So be it.
Cursed is he who takes his neighbour's landmark from its place. And let all the people say, So be it.
Cursed is he by whom the blind are turned out of the way. And let all the people say, So be it.
Cursed is he who gives a wrong decision in the cause of a man from a strange land, or of one without a father, or of a widow. And let all the people say, So be it.
Cursed is he who has sex relations with his father's wife, for he has put shame on his father. And let all the people say, So be it.
Cursed is he who has sex relations with any sort of beast. And let all the people say, So be it.
Cursed is he who has sex relations with his sister, the daughter of his father or of his mother. And let all the people say, So be it.
Cursed is he who has sex relations with his mother-in-law. And let all the people say, So be it.
Cursed is he who takes his neighbour's life secretly. And let all the people say, So be it.
Cursed is he who for a reward puts to death one who has done no wrong. And let all the people say, So be it.
Cursed is he who does not take this law to heart to do it. And let all the people say, So be it.
Now if you give ear to the voice of the Lord your God, and keep with care all these orders which I have given you today, then the Lord your God will put you high over all the nations of the earth:
And all these blessings will come on you and overtake you, if your ears are open to the voice of the Lord your God.
A blessing will be on you in the town, and a blessing in the field.
A blessing will be on the fruit of your body, and on the fruit of your land, on the fruit of your cattle, the increase of your herd, and the young of your flock.
A blessing will be on your basket and on your bread-basin.
A blessing will be on your coming in and on your going out.
By the power of the Lord, those who take arms against you will be overcome before you: they will come out against you one way, and will go in flight from you seven ways.
The Lord will send his blessing on your store-houses and on everything to which you put your hand: his blessing will be on you in the land which the Lord your God is giving you.
The Lord will keep you as a people holy to himself, as he has said to you in his oath, if you keep the orders of the Lord your God and go on walking in his ways.
And all the peoples of the earth will see that the name of the Lord is on you, and they will go in fear of you.
And the Lord will make you fertile in every good thing , in the fruit of your body , and the fruit of your cattle , and the fruit of your fields , in the land which the Lord , by his oath to your fathers , said he would
give you .
Opening his store-house in heaven, the Lord will send rain on your land at the right time, blessing all the work of your hands: other nations will make use of your wealth, and you will have no need of theirs.
The Lord will make you the head and not the tail; and you will ever have the highest place, if you give ear to the orders of the Lord your God which I give you today, to keep and to do them;
Not turning away from any of the orders which I give you today, to the right hand or to the left, or going after any other gods to give them worship.
But if you do not give ear to the voice of the Lord your God, and take care to do all his orders and his laws which I give you today, then all these curses will come on you and overtake you:
You will be cursed in the town and cursed in the field.
A curse will be on your basket and on your bread-basin.
A curse will be on the fruit of your body, and on the fruit of your land, on the increase of your cattle, and the young of your flock.
You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out.
The Lord will send on you cursing and trouble and punishment in everything to which you put your hand, till sudden destruction overtakes you; because of your evil ways in which you have been false to me.
The Lord will send disease after disease on you, till you have been cut off by death from the land to which you are going.
The Lord will send wasting disease, and burning pain, and flaming heat against you, keeping back the rain till your land is waste and dead; so will it be till your destruction is complete.
And the heaven over your heads will be brass, and the earth under you hard as iron.
The Lord will make the rain of your land powder and dust, sending it down on you from heaven till your destruction is complete.
The Lord will let you be overcome by your haters: you will go out against them one way, and you will go in flight before them seven ways: you will be the cause of fear among all the kingdoms of the earth.
Your bodies will be meat for all the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth; there will be no one to send them away.
The Lord will send on you the disease of Egypt, and other sorts of skin diseases which nothing will make well.
He will make your minds diseased, and your eyes blind, and your hearts wasted with fear:
You will go feeling your way when the sun is high, like a blind man for whom all is dark, and nothing will go well for you: you will be crushed and made poor for ever, and you will have no saviour.
You will take a wife, but another man will have the use of her: the house which your hands have made will never be your resting-place: you will make a vine-garden, and never take the fruit of it.
Your ox will be put to death before your eyes , but its flesh will not be your food : your ass will be violently taken away before your face , and will not be given back to you : your sheep will be given to your haters , and
there will be no saviour for you .
Your sons and your daughters will be given to another people, and your eyes will be wasted away with looking and weeping for them all the day: and you will have no power to do anything.
The fruit of your land and all the work of your hands will be food for a nation which is strange to you and to your fathers; you will only be crushed down and kept under for ever:
So that the things which your eyes have to see will send you out of your minds.
The Lord will send a skin disease, attacking your knees and your legs, bursting out from your feet to the top of your head, so that nothing will make you well.
And you, and the king whom you have put over you, will the Lord take away to a nation strange to you and to your fathers; there you will be servants to other gods of wood and stone.
And you will become a wonder and a name of shame among all the nations where the Lord will take you.
You will take much seed out into the field, and get little in; for the locust will get it.
You will put in vines and take care of them, but you will get no wine or grapes from them; for they will be food for worms.
Your land will be full of olive-trees, but there will be no oil for the comfort of your body; for your olive-tree will give no fruit.
You will have sons and daughters, but they will not be yours; for they will go away prisoners into a strange land.
All your trees and the fruit of your land will be the locust's.
The man from a strange land who is living among you will be lifted up higher and higher over you, while you go down lower and lower.
He will let you have his wealth at interest, and will have no need of yours: he will be the head and you the tail.
And all these curses will come after you and overtake you, till your destruction is complete; because you did not give ear to the voice of the Lord your God, or keep his laws and his orders which he gave you:
These things will come on you and on your seed, to be a sign and a wonder for ever;
Because you did not give honour to the Lord your God, worshipping him gladly, with joy in your hearts on account of all your wealth of good things;
For this cause you will become servants to those whom the Lord your God will send against you , without food and drink and clothing , and in need of all things : and he will put a yoke of iron on your neck till he has put an end
to you .
The Lord will send a nation against you from the farthest ends of the earth, coming with the flight of an eagle; a nation whose language is strange to you;
A hard-faced nation, who will have no respect for the old or mercy for the young:
He will take the fruit of your cattle and of your land till death puts an end to you : he will let you have nothing of your grain or wine or oil or any of the increase of your cattle or the young of your flock , till he
has made your destruction complete .
Your towns will be shut in by his armies, till your high walls, in which you put your faith, have come down: his armies will be round your towns, through all your land which the Lord your God has given you.
And your food will be the fruit of your body, the flesh of the sons and daughters which the Lord your God has given you; because of your bitter need and the cruel grip of your haters.
That man among you who is soft and used to comfort will be hard and cruel to his brother, and to his dear wife, and to of those his children who are still living;
And will not give to any of them the flesh of his children which will be his food because he has no other; in the cruel grip of your haters on all your towns.
The most soft and delicate of your women, who would not so much as put her foot on the earth, so delicate is she, will be hard-hearted to her husband and to her son and to her daughter;
And to her baby newly come to birth, and to the children of her body; for having no other food, she will make a meal of them secretly, because of her bitter need and the cruel grip of your haters on all your towns.
If you will not take care to do all the words of this law, recorded in this book, honouring that name of glory and of fear, THE LORD YOUR GOD;
Then the Lord your God will make your punishment, and the punishment of your seed, a thing to be wondered at; great punishments and cruel diseases stretching on through long years.
He will send on you again all the diseases of Egypt, which were a cause of fear to you, and they will take you in their grip.
And all the diseases and the pains not recorded in the book of this law will the Lord send on you till your destruction is complete.
And you will become a very small band, though your numbers were like the stars of heaven; because you did not give ear to the voice of the Lord your God.
And as the Lord took delight in doing you good and increasing you, so the Lord will take pleasure in cutting you off and causing your destruction, and you will be uprooted from the land which you are about to take as your heritage.
And the Lord will send you wandering among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other: there you will be servants to other gods, of wood and stone, gods of which you and your fathers had no knowledge.
And even among these nations there will be no peace for you, and no rest for your feet: but the Lord will give you there a shaking heart and wasting eyes and weariness of soul:
Your very life will be hanging in doubt before you, and day and night will be dark with fears, and nothing in life will be certain:
In the morning you will say, If only it was evening! And at evening you will say, If only morning would come! Because of the fear in your hearts and the things which your eyes will see.
And the Lord will take you back to Egypt again in ships , by the way of which I said to you , You will never see it again : there you will be offering yourselves as men-servants and women-servants to your haters for a price , and no man
will take you .
These are the words of the agreement which Moses was ordered by the Lord to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, in addition to the agreement which he made with them in Horeb.
And Moses said in the hearing of all Israel, You have seen all the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and to all his servants and all his land;
The great tests which your eyes saw, and the signs and wonders:
But even to this day the Lord has not given you a mind open to knowledge, or seeing eyes or hearing ears.
For forty years I have been your guide through the waste land: your clothing has not become old on your backs, or your shoes on your feet.
You have had no bread, or wine, or strong drink: so that you might see that I am the Lord your God.
When you came to this place, Sihon, king of Heshbon, and Og, king of Bashan, came out to make war against us and we overcame them:
And we took their land and gave it to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, for their heritage.
So keep the words of this agreement and do them, so that it may be well for you in everything you do.
You have come here today, all of you, before the Lord your God; the heads of your tribes, the overseers, and those who are in authority over you, with all the men of Israel,
And your little ones, your wives, and the men of other lands who are with you in your tents, down to the wood-cutter and the servant who gets water for you:
With the purpose of taking part in the agreement of the Lord your God, and his oath which he makes with you today:
And so that he may make you his people today, and be your God, as he has said to you, and as he made an oath to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
And not with you only do I make this agreement and this oath;
But with everyone who is here with us today before the Lord our God, as well as with those who are not here:
(For you have in mind how we were living in the land of Egypt; and how we came through all the nations which were on your way;
And you have seen their disgusting doings, and the images of wood and stone and silver and gold which were among them:)
So that there may not be among you any man or woman or family or tribe whose heart is turned away from the Lord our God today , to go after other gods and give them worship ; or any root among you whose fruit is poison and bitter sorrow
If such a man, hearing the words of this oath, takes comfort in the thought that he will have peace even if he goes on in the pride of his heart, taking whatever chance may give him:
The Lord will have no mercy on him, but the wrath of the Lord will be burning against that man, and all the curses recorded in this book will be waiting for him, and the Lord will take away his name completely from the earth.
He will be marked out by the Lord, from all the tribes of Israel, for an evil fate, in keeping with all the curses of the agreement recorded in this book of the law.
And future generations, your children coming after you, and travellers from far countries, will say, when they see the punishments of that land and the diseases which the Lord has sent on it;
And that all the land is a salt and smoking waste, not planted or giving fruit or clothed with grass, but wasted like Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, on which the Lord sent destruction in the heat of his wrath:
Truly all the nations will say, Why has the Lord done so to this land? what is the reason for this great and burning wrath?
Then men will say, Because they gave up the agreement of the Lord, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he took them out of the land of Egypt:
And they went after other gods and gave them worship, gods who were strange to them, and whom he had not given them:
And so the wrath of the Lord was moved against this land, to send on it all the curse recorded in this book:
Rooting them out of their land, in the heat of his wrath and passion, and driving them out into another land, as at this day.
The secret things are the Lord our God's: but the things which have been made clear are ours and our children's for ever, so that we may do all the words of this law.
Then turning we took the road to Bashan: and Og, king of Bashan, came out against us with all his people, and made an attack on us at Edrei.
And the Lord said to me, Have no fear of him: for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hands; do to him as you did to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who was ruling in Heshbon.
So the Lord our God gave up Og, king of Bashan, and all his people into our hands; and we overcame him so completely that all his people came to their end in the fight.
At that time we took all his towns; there was not one town of the sixty towns, all the country of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which we did not take.
All these towns had high walls round them with doors and locks; and in addition we took a great number of unwalled towns.
And we put them to the curse, every town together with men, women, and children.
But we took for ourselves all the cattle and the stored wealth of the towns.
At that time we took their land from the two kings of the Amorites on the far side of Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon;
(By the Sidonians, Hermon is named Sirion, and by the Amorites Shenir;)
All the towns of the table-land and all Gilead and Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, towns of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
( For Og , king of Bashan , was the last of all the Rephaim ; his bed was made of iron ; is it not in Rabbah , in the land of the children of Ammon ? It was nine cubits long and four cubits wide , measured by
the common cubit . )
And this land which we took at that time, from Aroer by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill-country of Gilead with its towns, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites.
The rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, all the land of Argob, together with Bashan, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (This land is named the land of the Rephaim.
Jair, the son of Manasseh, took all the land of Argob, as far as the country of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, naming it, Bashan, Havvoth-Jair after himself, as it is to this day.)
And Gilead I gave to Machir.
And the land from Gilead to the valley of the Arnon, with the middle of the valley as a limit, as far as the river Jabbok which is the limit of the country of the children of Ammon, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites;
As well as the Arabah, with the river Jordan as their limit, from Chinnereth to the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah to the east.
At that time I gave you orders, saying, The Lord has given you this land for your heritage: all the men of war are to go over armed before your brothers the children of Israel.
But your wives and your little ones and your cattle (for it is clear that you have much cattle) may go on living in the towns I have given you;
Till the Lord has given rest to your brothers as to you , and till they have taken for themselves the land which the Lord your God is giving them on the other side of Jordan : then you may go back , every man of you , to the
heritage which I have given you .
And I gave orders to Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen what the Lord your God has done to these two kings: so will the Lord do to all the kingdoms into which you come.
Have no fear of them, for the Lord your God will be fighting for you.
And at that time I made request to the Lord, saying,
O Lord God, you have now for the first time let your servant see your great power and the strength of your hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth able to do such great works and such acts of power?
Let me go over, O Lord, and see the good land on the other side of Jordan, and that fair mountain country, even Lebanon.
But the Lord was angry with me because of you and would not give ear to my prayer; and the Lord said to me, Let it be enough, say no more about this thing.
Go up to the top of Pisgah, and turning your eyes to the west and the north, to the south and the east, see the land with your eyes: for you are not to go over Jordan.
But give my orders to Joshua, comforting him and making him strong; for he is to go over Jordan at the head of this people, and he will give them this land which you will see for their heritage.
So we were waiting in the valley facing Beth-peor.
Now when all these things have come on you, the blessing and the curse which I have put before you, if the thought of them comes back to your minds, when you are living among the nations where the Lord your God has sent you,
And your hearts are turned again to the Lord your God, and you give ear to his word which I give you today, you and your children, with all your heart and with all your soul:
Then the Lord will have pity on you, changing your fate, and taking you back again from among all the nations where you have been forced to go.
Even if those who have been forced out are living in the farthest part of heaven, the Lord your God will go in search of you, and take you back;
Placing you again in the land of your fathers as your heritage; and he will do you good, increasing you till you are more in number than your fathers were.
And the Lord your God will give to you and to your seed a circumcision of the heart, so that, loving him with all your heart and all your soul, you may have life.
And the Lord your God will put all these curses on those who are against you, and on your haters who put a cruel yoke on you.
And you will again give ear to the voice of the Lord, and do all his orders which I have given you today.
And the Lord your God will make you fertile in all good things , blessing the work of your hands , and the fruit of your body , and the fruit of your cattle , and the fruit of your land : for the Lord will have joy in you
, as he had in your fathers :
If you give ear to the voice of the Lord your God, keeping his orders and his laws which are recorded in this book of the law, and turning to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
For these orders which I have given you today are not strange and secret, and are not far away.
They are not in heaven, for you to say, Who will go up to heaven for us and give us knowledge of them so that we may do them?
And they are not across the sea, for you to say, Who will go over the sea for us and give us news of them so that we may do them?
But the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, so that you may do it.
See, I have put before you today, life and good, and death and evil;
In giving you orders today to have love for the Lord your God , to go in his ways and keep his laws and his orders and his decisions , so that you may have life and be increased , and that the blessing of the Lord your God may
be with you in the land where you are going , the land of your heritage .
But if your heart is turned away and your ear is shut, and you go after those who would make you servants and worshippers of other gods:
I give witness against you this day that destruction will certainly be your fate, and your days will be cut short in the land where you are going, the land of your heritage on the other side of Jordan.
Let heaven and earth be my witnesses against you this day that I have put before you life and death, a blessing and a curse: so take life for yourselves and for your seed:
In loving the Lord your God , hearing his voice and being true to him : for he is your life and by him will your days be long : so that you may go on living in the land which the Lord gave by an oath to your fathers
, Abraham , Isaac and Jacob .
So Moses said all these things to Israel.
Then he said to them, I am now a hundred and twenty years old; I am no longer able to go out and come in: and the Lord has said to me, You are not to go over Jordan.
The Lord your God, he will go over before you; he will send destruction on all those nations, and you will take their land as your heritage: and Joshua will go over at your head as the Lord has said.
The Lord will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, whom he put to destruction.
The Lord will give them up into your hands, and you are to do to them as I have given you orders.
Be strong and take heart, and have no fear of them: for it is the Lord your God who is going with you; he will not take away his help from you.
Then Moses sent for Joshua , and before the eyes of all Israel said to him , Be strong and take heart : for you are to go with this people into the land which the Lord , by his oath to their fathers , has given them ; by
your help they will take it for their heritage .
It is the Lord who goes before you; he will be with you, he will not take away his help from you or give you up: so have no fear.
Then Moses put all this law in writing, and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who take up the ark of the Lord's agreement, and to all the responsible men of Israel.
And Moses said to them, At the end of every seven years, at the time fixed for the ending of debts, at the feast of tents,
When all Israel has come before the Lord your God in the place named by him, let a reading be given of this law in the hearing of all Israel.
Make all the people come together , men and women and children , and anyone from another country who is with you , so that hearing they may become wise in the fear of the Lord your God , and take care to do all the words of this law
And so that your children, to whom it is new, may give ear and be trained in the fear of the Lord your God, while you are living in the land which you are going over Jordan to take for your heritage.
At that time the Lord said to Moses, The day of your death is near: send for Joshua, and come to the Tent of meeting so that I may give him his orders. So Moses and Joshua went to the Tent of meeting.
And the Lord was seen in the Tent in a pillar of cloud resting by the door of the Tent.
And the Lord said to Moses , Now you are going to rest with your fathers ; and this people will be false to me , uniting themselves to the strange gods of the land where they are going ; they will be turned away from me and will not
keep the agreement I have made with them .
In that day my wrath will be moved against them , and I will be turned away from them , veiling my face from them , and destruction will overtake them , and unnumbered evils and troubles will come on them ; so that in that day they will say
, Have not these evils come on us because our God is not with us ?
Truly, my face will be turned away from them in that day, because of all the evil they have done in going after other gods.
Make then this song for yourselves, teaching it to the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, so that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
For when I have taken them into the land named in my oath to their fathers , a land flowing with milk and honey , and they have made themselves full of food and are fat , then they will be turned to other gods and will give them worship
, no longer honouring me or keeping my agreement .
Then when evils and troubles without number have overtaken them , this song will be a witness to them , for the words of it will be clear in the memories of their children : for I see the thoughts which are moving in their hearts even now , before
I have taken them into the land of my oath .
So that same day Moses made this song, teaching it to the children of Israel.
Then he gave orders to Joshua , the son of Nun , saying to him , Be strong and take heart : for you are to go at the head of the children of Israel into the land which I made an oath to give them ; and I will
be with you .
Now after writing all the words of this law in a book till the record of them was complete,
Moses said to the Levites who were responsible for taking up the ark of the Lord's agreement,
Take this book of the law and put it by the ark of the Lord's agreement, so that it may be a witness against you.
For I have knowledge of your hard and uncontrolled hearts: even now, while I am still living, you will not be ruled by the Lord; how much less after my death?
Get together before me all those who are in authority in your tribes, and your overseers, so that I may say these things in their hearing, and make heaven and earth my witnesses against them.
For I am certain that after my death you will give yourselves up to sin , wandering from the way which I have given you ; and evil will overtake you in the end , because you will do evil in the eyes of the Lord , moving him to
wrath by the work of your hands .
Then in the hearing of all the meeting of Israel, Moses said the words of this song, to the end.
Give ear, O heavens, to my voice; let the earth take note of the words of my mouth:
My teaching is dropping like rain, coming down like dew on the fields; like rain on the young grass and showers on the garden plants:
For I will give honour to the name of the Lord: let our God be named great.
He is the Rock, complete is his work; for all his ways are righteousness: a God without evil who keeps faith, true and upright is he.
They have become false, they are not his children, the mark of sin is on them; they are an evil and hard-hearted generation.
Is this your answer to the Lord, O foolish people and unwise? Is he not your father who has given you life? He has made you and given you your place.
Keep in mind the days of the past, give thought to the years of generations gone by: go to your father and he will make it clear to you, to the old men and they will give you the story.
When the Most High gave the nations their heritage, separating into groups the children of men, he had the limits of the peoples marked out, keeping in mind the number of the children of Israel.
For the Lord's wealth is his people; Jacob is the land of his heritage.
He came to him in the waste land, in the unpeopled waste of sand: putting his arms round him and caring for him, he kept him as the light of his eye.
As an eagle, teaching her young to make their flight, with her wings outstretched over them, takes them up on her strong feathers:
So the Lord only was his guide, no other god was with him.
He put him on the high places of the earth, his food was the increase of the field; honey he gave him out of the rock and oil out of the hard rock;
Butter from his cows and milk from his sheep, with fat of lambs and sheep of Bashan, and goats, and the heart of the grain; and for your drink, wine from the blood of the grape.
But Jeshurun became fat and would not be controlled: you have become fat, you are thick and full of food: then he was untrue to the God who made him, giving no honour to the Rock of his salvation.
The honour which was his they gave to strange gods; by their disgusting ways he was moved to wrath.
They made offerings to evil spirits which were not God, to gods who were strange to them, which had newly come up, not feared by your fathers.
You have no thought for the Rock, your father, you have no memory of the God who gave you birth.
And the Lord saw with disgust the evil-doing of his sons and daughters.
And he said, My face will be veiled from them, I will see what their end will be: for they are an uncontrolled generation, children in whom is no faith.
They have given my honour to that which is not God, moving me to wrath with their false worship: I will give their honour to those who are not a people, moving them to wrath by a foolish nation,
For my wrath is a flaming fire, burning to the deep parts of the underworld, burning up the earth with her increase, and firing the deep roots of the mountains.
See, the money which was in the mouth of our bags we gave back to you when we came again from Canaan: how then might we take silver or gold from your lord's house?
If it comes to light that any of your servants has done this, let him be put to death, and we will be your lord's servants.
And he said, Let it be as you say: he in whose bag it is seen will become my servant; and you will not be responsible.
Then every man quickly got his bag down and undid it.
And he made a search, starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was in Benjamin's bag.
Then in bitter grief they put the bags on the asses again and went back to the town.
So Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house; and he was still there: and they went down on their faces before him.
And Joseph said, What is this thing which you have done? had you no thought that such a man as I would have power to see what is secret?
And Judah said , What are we to say to my lord ? how may we put ourselves right in his eyes ? God has made clear the sin of your servants : now we are in your hands , we and the man in whose bag your cup was
seen .
Then he said, Far be it from me to do so: but the man who had my cup will be my servant; and you may go back to your father in peace.
Then Judah came near him, and said, Let your servant say a word in my lord's ears, and let not your wrath be burning against your servant: for you are in the place of Pharaoh to us.
My lord said to his servants, Have you a father or a brother?
And we said to my lord, We have an old father and a young child, whom he had when he was old; his brother is dead and he is the only son of his mother, and is very dear to his father.
And you said to your servants, Let him come down to me with you, so that I may see him.
And we said to my lord, His father will not let him go; for if he went away his father would come to his death.
But you said to your servants, If your youngest brother does not come with you, you will not see my face again.
And when we went back to your servant, our father, we gave him an account of my lord's words.
And our father said, Go again and get us a little food.
And we said, Only if our youngest brother goes with us will we go down; for we may not see the man's face again if our youngest brother is not with us.
And our father said to us, You have knowledge that my wife gave me two sons;
The one went away from me, and I said, Truly he has come to a violent death; and from that time I have not seen him,
If now you take this one from me, and some evil comes to him, you will make my grey head go down in sorrow to the underworld.
If then I go back to your servant, my father, without the boy, because his life and the boy's life are one,
When he sees that the boy is not with us, he will come to his death, and our father's grey head will go down in sorrow to the underworld.
For I made myself responsible for the boy to my father, saying, If I do not give him safely back to you, let mine be the sin for ever.
So now let me be my lord's servant here in place of the boy, and let him go back with his brothers.
For how may I go back to my father without the boy, and see the evil which will come on my father?
Then Joseph, unable to keep back his feelings before those who were with him, gave orders for everyone to be sent away, and no one was present when he made clear to his brothers who he was.
And so loud was his weeping, that it came to the ears of the Egyptians and all Pharaoh's house.
And Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph: is my father still living? But his brothers were not able to give him an answer for they were troubled before him.
Then Joseph said to his brothers, Come near to me. And they came near, And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom you sent into Egypt.
Now do not be troubled or angry with yourselves for sending me away, because God sent me before you to be the saviour of your lives.
For these two years have been years of need, and there are still five more years to come in which there will be no ploughing or cutting of grain.
God sent me before you to keep you and yours living on earth so that you might become a great nation.
So now it was not you who sent me here, but God: and he has made me as a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
Now go quickly to my father, and say to him, Your son Joseph says, God has made me ruler over all the land of Egypt: come down to me straight away:
The land of Goshen will be your living-place, and you will be near me; you and your children and your children's children, and your flocks and herds and all you have:
And there I will take care of you, so that you and your family may not be in need, for there are still five bad years to come.
Now truly, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my mouth which says these things to you.
Give my father word of all my glory in Egypt and of all you have seen; and come back quickly with my father.
Then, weeping, he took Benjamin in his arms, and Benjamin himself was weeping on Joseph's neck.
Then he gave a kiss to all his brothers, weeping over them; and after that his brothers had no fear of talking to him.
And news of these things went through Pharaoh's house, and it was said that Joseph's brothers were come; and it seemed good to Pharaoh and his servants.
And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to your brothers, Put your goods on your beasts and go back to the land of Canaan;
And get your father and your families and come back to me: and I will give you all the good things of Egypt, and the fat of the land will be your food.
And say to them, This you are to do: take carts from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and get your father and come back.
And take no thought for your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.
And the children of Israel did as he said; and Joseph gave them carts as had been ordered by Pharaoh, and food for their journey.
To every one of them he gave three changes of clothing; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred bits of silver and five changes of clothing.
And to his father he sent ten asses with good things from Egypt on their backs, and ten she-asses with grain and bread and food for his father on the journey.
And he sent his brothers on their way, and said to them, See that you have no argument on the road.
So they went up from Egypt and came to the land of Canaan, to their father Jacob.
And they said to him, Joseph is living, and is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And at this word Jacob was quite overcome, for he had no faith in it.
And they gave him an account of everything Joseph had said to them; and when he saw the carts which Joseph had sent for them, his spirit came back to him:
And Israel said, It is enough: Joseph my son is still living; I will go and see him before my death.
And Israel went on his journey with all he had, and came to Beer-sheba, where he made offerings to the God of his father Isaac.
And God said to Israel in a night-vision, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.
And he said, I am God, the God of your father: go down to Egypt without fear, for I will make a great nation of you there:
I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will see that you come back again, and at your death Joseph will put his hands on your eyes.
Then Jacob went on from Beer-sheba; and the sons of Jacob took their father and their little ones and their wives in the carts which Pharaoh had sent for them.
And they took their cattle and all the goods which they had got in the land of Canaan, and came to Egypt, even Jacob and all his seed:
His sons and his sons' sons, his daughters and his daughters' sons and all his family he took with him into Egypt.
And these are the names of the children of Israel who came into Egypt, even Jacob and all his sons: Reuben, Jacob's oldest son;
And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch and Pallu and Hezron and Carmi;
And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul, the son of a woman of Canaan;
And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari;
And the sons of Judah: Er and Onan and Shelah and Perez and Zerah: but Er and Onan had come to their death in the land of Canaan; and the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
And the sons of Issachar: Tola and Puah and Job and Shimron;
And the sons of Zebulun: Sered and Elon and Jahleel;
All these, together with his daughter Dinah, were the children of Leah, whom Jacob had by her in Paddan-aram; they were thirty-three in number.
And the sons of Gad: Ziphion and Haggi, Shuni and Ezbon, Eri and Arodi and Areli;
And the sons of Asher: Jimnah and Ishvah and Ishvi and Beriah, and Sarah, their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.
These are the children of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah, and Jacob had these sixteen children by her.
The sons of Jacob's wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
And Joseph had Manasseh and Ephraim in the land of Egypt, by Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera, priest of On.
And the sons of Benjamin were Belah and Becher and Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, Muppim and Huppim and Ard.
All these were the children of Rachel whom Jacob had by her, fourteen persons.
And the son of Dan was Hushim.
And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel and Guni and Jezer and Shillem.
These were the children of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel, seven persons.
All the persons who came with Jacob into Egypt, the offspring of his body, were sixty-six, without taking into account the wives of Jacob's sons.
And the sons of Joseph whom he had in Egypt were two. Seventy persons of the family of Jacob came into Egypt.
Now he had sent Judah before him to Goshen, to get word from Joseph; and so they came to the land of Goshen.
And Joseph got his carriage ready and went to Goshen for the meeting with his father; and when he came before him, he put his arms round his neck, weeping.
And Israel said to Joseph, Now that I have seen you living again, I am ready for death.
And Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's people, I will go and give the news to Pharaoh, and say to him, My brothers and my father's people, from the land of Canaan, have come to me;
And these men are keepers of sheep and owners of cattle, and have with them their flocks and their herds and all they have.
Now when Pharaoh sends for you and says, What is your business?
You are to say , Your servants have been keepers of cattle from our early days up to now , like our fathers ; in this way you will be able to have the land of Goshen for yourselves ; because keepers of sheep are unclean in the eyes of
the Egyptians .
Then Joseph went to Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brothers with their flocks and their herds and all they have, are come from Canaan, and are now in the land of Goshen.
And he took five of his brothers to Pharaoh.
And Pharaoh said to them, What is your business? And they said, Your servants are keepers of sheep, as our fathers were before us.
And they said to Pharaoh, We have come to make a living in this land, because we have no grass for our flocks in the land of Canaan; so now let your servants make a place for themselves in the land of Goshen.
And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Let them have the land of Goshen; and if there are any able men among them, put them over my cattle.
And Jacob and his sons came to Joseph in Egypt , and when word of it came to the ears of Pharaoh , king of Egypt , he said to Joseph , Your father and brothers have come to you ; all the land of Egypt is before you ;
let your father and your brothers have the best of the land for their resting-place .
Then Joseph made his father Jacob come before Pharaoh, and Jacob gave him his blessing.
And Pharaoh said to him, How old are you?
And Jacob said, The years of my wanderings have been a hundred and thirty; small in number and full of sorrow have been the years of my life, and less than the years of the wanderings of my fathers.
And Jacob gave Pharaoh his blessing, and went out from before him.
And Joseph made a place for his father and his brothers, and gave them a heritage in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had given orders.
And Joseph took care of his father and his brothers and all his father's people, giving them food for the needs of their families.
Now there was no food to be had in all the land, so that all Egypt and Canaan were wasted from need of food.
And all the money in Egypt and in the land of Canaan which had been given for grain, came into the hands of Joseph: and he put it in Pharaoh's house.
And when all the money in Egypt and Canaan was gone, the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread; would you have us come to destruction before your eyes? for we have no more money.
And Joseph said, Give me your cattle; I will give you grain in exchange for your cattle if your money is all gone.
So they took their cattle to Joseph and he gave them bread in exchange for their horses and flocks and herds and asses, so all that year he gave them food in exchange for their cattle.
And when that year was ended , they came to him in the second year , and said , We may not keep it from our lord ' s knowledge that all our money is gone , and all the herds of cattle are my lord ' s ; there
is nothing more to give my lord but our bodies and our land ;
Are we to come to destruction before your eyes , we and our land ? take us and our land and give us bread ; and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh ; and give us seed so that we may have life and the land may
not become waste .
So Joseph got all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh; for every Egyptian gave up his land in exchange for food, because of their great need; so all the land became Pharaoh's.
And as for the people, he made servants of them, town by town, from one end of Egypt to the other.
Only he did not take the land of the priests, for the priests had their food given them by Pharaoh, and having what Pharaoh gave them, they had no need to give up their land.
Then Joseph said to the people, I have made you and your land this day the property of Pharaoh; here is seed for you to put in your fields.
And when the grain is cut, you are to give a fifth part to Pharaoh, and four parts will be yours for seed and food, and for your families and your little ones.
And they said to him, Truly you have kept us from death; may we have grace in your eyes, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.
Then Joseph made a law which is in force to this day, that Pharaoh was to have the fifth part; only the land of the priests did not become his.
And so Israel was living among the Egyptians in the land of Goshen; and they got property there, and became very great in numbers and in wealth.
And Jacob was living in the land of Goshen for seventeen years; so the years of his life were a hundred and forty-seven.
And the time of his death came near, and he sent for his son Joseph and said to him, If now I am dear to you, put your hand under my leg and take an oath that you will not put me to rest in Egypt;
But when I go to my fathers, you are to take me out of Egypt and put me to rest in their last resting-place. And he said, I will do so.
And he said, Take an oath to me; and he took an oath to him: and Israel gave worship on the bed's head.
Now after these things, word came to Joseph that his father was ill: and he took with him his sons Manasseh and Ephraim.
And when they said to Jacob, Your son Joseph is coming to see you: then Israel, getting all his strength together, had himself lifted up in his bed.
And Jacob said to Joseph, God, the Ruler of all, came to me in a vision at Luz in the land of Canaan, and gave me his blessing,
And said to me, Truly, I will make you fertile and give you increase and will make of you a great family of nations: and I will give this land to your seed after you to be their heritage for ever.
And now your two sons who came to birth in Egypt before I came to you here, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, in the same way as Reuben and Simeon are.
And any other offspring which you have after them, will be yours, and will be named after their brothers in their heritage.
And as for me, when I came from Paddan, death overtook Rachel on the way, when we were still some distance from Ephrath; and I put her to rest there on the road to Ephrath, which is Beth-lehem.
Then Israel, looking at Joseph's sons, said, Who are these?
And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me in this land. And he said, Let them come near me, and I will give them a blessing.
Now because Israel was old, his eyes were no longer clear, and he was not able to see. So he made them come near to him, and he gave them a kiss, folding them in his arms.
And Israel said to Joseph, I had no hope of seeing your face again, but God in his mercy has let me see you and your children.
Then Joseph took them from between his knees, and went down on his face to the earth.
Then taking Ephraim with his right hand, Joseph put him at Israel's left side, and with his left hand he put Manasseh at Israel's right side, placing them near him.
And Israel, stretching out his right hand, put it on the head of Ephraim, the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands on purpose, for Manasseh was the older.
And he gave Joseph a blessing, saying, May the God to whom my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, gave worship, the God who has taken care of me all my life till this day,
The angel who has been my saviour from all evil, send his blessing on these children: and let my name and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, be given to them; and let them become a great nation in the earth.
Now when Joseph saw that his father had put his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it did not seem right to him; and lifting his father's hand he would have put it on the head of Manasseh.
And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this is the older; put your right hand on his head.
But his father would not, saying, I am doing it on purpose, my son; he will certainly become a nation and a great one; but his younger brother will be greater than he, and his seed will become a great family of nations.
So he gave them his blessing that day, saying, You will be the sign of blessing in Israel, for they will say, May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh; and he put Ephraim before Manasseh.
Then Israel said to Joseph, Now my death is near; but God will be with you, guiding you back to the land of your fathers.
And I have given you more than your brothers, even Shechem as your heritage, which I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow.
And Jacob sent for his sons, and said, Come together, all of you, so that I may give you news of your fate in future times.
Come near, O sons of Jacob, and give ear to the words of Israel your father.
Reuben, you are my oldest son, the first-fruit of my strength, first in pride and first in power:
But because you were uncontrolled, the first place will not be yours; for you went up to your father's bed, even his bride-bed, and made it unclean.
Simeon and Levi are brothers; deceit and force are their secret designs.
Take no part in their secrets, O my soul; keep far away, O my heart, from their meetings; for in their wrath they put men to death, and for their pleasure even oxen were wounded.
A curse on their passion for it was bitter; and on their wrath for it was cruel. I will let their heritage in Jacob be broken up, driving them from their places in Israel.
To you, Judah, will your brothers give praise: your hand will be on the neck of your haters; your father's sons will go down to the earth before you.
Judah is a young lion; like a lion full of meat you have become great, my son; now he takes his rest like a lion stretched out and like an old lion; by whom will his sleep be broken?
The rod of authority will not be taken from Judah, and he will not be without a law-giver, till he comes who has the right to it, and the peoples will put themselves under his rule.
Knotting his ass's cord to the vine, and his young ass to the best vine; washing his robe in wine, and his clothing in the blood of grapes:
His eyes will be dark with wine, and his teeth white with milk.
The resting-place of Zebulun will be by the sea, and he will be a harbour for ships; the edge of his land will be by Zidon.
Issachar is a strong ass stretched out among the flocks:
And he saw that rest was good and the land was pleasing; so he let them put weights on his back and became a servant.
Dan will be the judge of his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
May Dan be a snake in the way, a horned snake by the road, biting the horse's foot so that the horseman has a fall.
I have been waiting for your salvation, O Lord.
Gad, an army will come against him, but he will come down on them in their flight.
Asher's bread is fat; he gives delicate food for kings.
Naphtali is a roe let loose, giving fair young ones.
Joseph is a young ox, whose steps are turned to the fountain;
He was troubled by the archers; they sent out their arrows against him, cruelly wounding him:
But their bows were broken by a strong one, and the cords of their arms were cut by the Strength of Jacob, by the name of the Stone of Israel:
Even by the God of your father , who will be your help , and by the Ruler of all , who will make you full with blessings from heaven on high , blessings of the deep stretched out under the earth , blessings of the breasts and of the
fertile body :
Blessings of sons, old and young, to the father: blessings of the oldest mountains and the fruit of the eternal hills: let them come on the head of Joseph, on the crown of him who was separate from his brothers.
Benjamin is a wolf, searching for meat: in the morning he takes his food, and in the evening he makes division of what he has taken.
These are the twelve tribes of Israel: and these are the words their father said to them, blessing them; to every one he gave his blessing.
And he gave orders to them, saying, Put me to rest with my people and with my fathers, in the hollow of the rock in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
In the rock in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in the land of Canaan, which Abraham got from Ephron the Hittite, to be his resting-place.
There Abraham and Sarah his wife were put to rest, and there they put Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I put Leah to rest.
In the rock in the field which was got for a price from the people of Heth.
And when Jacob had come to the end of these words to his sons, stretching himself on his bed, he gave up his spirit, and went the way of his people.
This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day when God made man, he made him in the image of God;
Male and female he made them, naming them Man, and giving them his blessing on the day when they were made.
Adam had been living for a hundred and thirty years when he had a son like himself, after his image, and gave him the name of Seth:
And after the birth of Seth, Adam went on living for eight hundred years, and had sons and daughters:
And all the years of Adam's life were nine hundred and thirty: and he came to his end.
And Seth was a hundred and five years old when he became the father of Enosh:
And he went on living after the birth of Enosh for eight hundred and seven years, and had sons and daughters:
And all the years of Seth's life were nine hundred and twelve: and he came to his end.
And Enosh was ninety years old when he became the father of Kenan:
And after the birth of Kenan, Enosh went on living for eight hundred and fifteen years, and had sons and daughters:
And all the years of Enosh were nine hundred and five: and he came to his end.
And Kenan was seventy years old when he became the father of Mahalalel:
And after the birth of Mahalalel, Kenan went on living for eight hundred and forty years, and had sons and daughters:
And all the years of Kenan's life were nine hundred and ten; and he came to his end.
And Mahalalel was sixty-five years old when he became the father of Jared:
And after the birth of Jared, Mahalalel went on living for eight hundred and thirty years, and had sons and daughters:
And all the years of Mahalalel's life were eight hundred and ninety-five: and he came to his end.
And Jared was a hundred and sixty-two years old when he became the father of Enoch:
And Jared went on living after the birth of Enoch for eight hundred years, and had sons and daughters:
And all the years of Jared's life were nine hundred and sixty-two: and he came to his end.
And Enoch was sixty-five years old when he became the father of Methuselah:
And after the birth of Methuselah, Enoch went on in God's ways for three hundred years, and had sons and daughters:
And all the years of Enoch's life were three hundred and sixty-five:
And Enoch went on in God's ways: and he was not seen again, for God took him.
And Methuselah was a hundred and eighty-seven years old when he became the father of Lamech:
And after the birth of Lamech, Methuselah went on living for seven hundred and eighty-two years, and had sons and daughters:
And all the years of Methuselah's life were nine hundred and sixty-nine: and he came to his end.
And Lamech was a hundred and eighty-two years old when he had a son:
And he gave him the name of Noah, saying, Truly, he will give us rest from our trouble and the hard work of our hands, because of the earth which was cursed by God.
And after the birth of Noah, Lamech went on living for five hundred and ninety-five years, and had sons and daughters:
And all the years of Lamech's life were seven hundred and seventy-seven: and he came to his end.
And when Noah was five hundred years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
And Joseph put his head down on his father's face, weeping and kissing him.
And Joseph gave orders to his servants who had the necessary knowledge, to make his father's body ready, folding it in linen with spices, and they did so.
And the forty days needed for making the body ready went by: and there was weeping for him among the Egyptians for seventy days.
And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph said to the servants of Pharaoh, If now you have love for me, say these words to Pharaoh:
My father made me take an oath , saying , When I am dead , put me to rest in the place I have made ready for myself in the land of Canaan . So now let me go and put my father in his last resting-place , and I
will come back again .
And Pharaoh said, Go up and put your father to rest, as you gave your oath to him.
So Joseph went up to put his father in his last resting-place; and with him went all the servants of Pharaoh, and the chief men of his house and all the chiefs of the land of Egypt,
And all the family of Joseph, and his brothers and his father's people: only their little ones and their flocks and herds they did not take with them from the land of Goshen.
And carriages went up with him and horsemen, a great army.
And they came to the grain-floor of Atad on the other side of Jordan, and there they gave the last honours to Jacob, with great and bitter sorrow, weeping for their father for seven days.
And when the people of the land, the people of Canaan, at the grain-floor of Atad, saw their grief, they said, Great is the grief of the Egyptians: so the place was named Abel-mizraim, on the other side of Jordan.
So his sons did as he had given them orders to do:
For they took him into the land of Canaan and put him to rest in the hollow rock in the field of Machpelah, which Abraham got with the field, for a resting-place, from Ephron the Hittite at Mamre.
And when his father had been put to rest, Joseph and his brothers and all who had gone with him, went back to Egypt.
Now after the death of their father, Joseph's brothers said to themselves, It may be that Joseph's heart will be turned against us, and he will give us punishment for all the evil which we did to him.
So they sent word to Joseph, saying, Your father, before his death, gave us orders, saying,
You are to say to Joseph , Let the wrongdoing of your brothers be overlooked , and the evil they did to you : now , if it is your pleasure , let the sin of the servants of your father ' s God have forgiveness . And at these
words , Joseph was overcome with weeping .
Then his brothers went, and falling at his feet, said, Truly, we are your servants.
And Joseph said, Have no fear: am I in the place of God?
As for you, it was in your mind to do me evil, but God has given a happy outcome, the salvation of numbers of people, as you see today.
So now, have no fear: for I will take care of you and your little ones. So he gave them comfort with kind words.
Now Joseph and all his father's family went on living in Egypt: and the years of Joseph's life were a hundred and ten.
And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: and the children of Machir, the son of Manasseh, came to birth on Joseph's knees.
Then Joseph said to his brothers, The time of my death has come; but God will keep you in mind and take you out of this land into the land which he gave by his oath to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.
Then Joseph made the children of Israel take an oath, saying, God will certainly give effect to his word, and you are to take my bones away from here.
So Joseph came to his death, being a hundred and ten years old: and they made his body ready, and he was put in a chest in Egypt.
And after a time, when men were increasing on the earth, and had daughters,
The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair; and they took wives for themselves from those who were pleasing to them.
And the Lord said, My spirit will not be in man for ever, for he is only flesh; so the days of his life will be a hundred and twenty years.
There were men of great strength and size on the earth in those days ; and after that , when the sons of God had connection with the daughters of men , they gave birth to children : these were the great men of old days , the men of
great name .
And the Lord saw that the sin of man was great on the earth, and that all the thoughts of his heart were evil.
And the Lord had sorrow because he had made man on the earth, and grief was in his heart.
And the Lord said, I will take away man, whom I have made, from the face of the earth, even man and beast and that which goes on the earth and every bird of the air; for I have sorrow for having made them.
But Noah had grace in the eyes of God.
These are the generations of Noah. Noah was an upright man and without sin in his generation: he went in the ways of God.
And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
And the earth was evil in God's eyes and full of violent ways.
And God, looking on the earth, saw that it was evil: for the way of all flesh had become evil on the earth.
And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come; the earth is full of their violent doings, and now I will put an end to them with the earth.
Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood with rooms in it, and make it safe from the water inside and out.
And this is the way you are to make it: it is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high.
You are to put a window in the ark, a cubit from the roof, and a door in the side of it, and you are to make it with a lower and second and third floors.
For truly, I will send a great flow of waters over the earth, for the destruction from under the heaven of all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything on the earth will come to an end.
But with you I will make an agreement; and you will come into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you.
And you will take with you into the ark two of every sort of living thing, and keep them safe with you; they will be male and female.
Two of every sort of bird and cattle and of every sort of living thing which goes on the earth will you take with you to keep them from destruction.
And make a store of every sort of food for yourself and them.
And all these things Noah did; as God said, so he did.
And the Lord said to Noah, Take all your family and go into the ark, for you only in this generation have I seen to be upright.
Of every clean beast you will take seven males and seven females, and of the beasts which are not clean, two, the male and his female;
And of the birds of the air, seven males and seven females, so that their seed may still be living on the face of the earth.
For after seven days I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, for the destruction of every living thing which I have made on the face of the earth.
And Noah did everything which the Lord said he was to do.
And Noah was six hundred years old when the waters came flowing over all the earth.
And Noah, with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives, went into the ark because of the flowing of the waters.
Of clean beasts, and of beasts which are not clean, and of birds, and of everything which goes on the earth,
In twos, male and female, they went into the ark with Noah, as God had said.
And after the seven days, the waters came over all the earth.
In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, all the fountains of the great deep came bursting through, and the windows of heaven were open;
And rain came down on the earth for forty days and forty nights.
On the same day Noah, with Shem, Ham, and Japheth, his sons, and his wife and his sons' wives, went into the ark;
And with them, every sort of beast and cattle, and every sort of thing which goes on the earth, and every sort of bird.
They went with Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh in which is the breath of life.
Male and female of all flesh went in, as God had said, and the ark was shut by the Lord.
And for forty days the waters were over all the earth; and the waters were increased so that the ark was lifted up high over the earth.
And the waters overcame everything and were increased greatly on the earth, and the ark was resting on the face of the waters.
And the waters overcame everything on the earth; and all the mountains under heaven were covered.
The waters went fifteen cubits higher, till all the mountains were covered.
And destruction came on every living thing moving on the earth, birds and cattle and beasts and everything which went on the earth, and every man.
Everything on the dry land, in which was the breath of life, came to its end.
Every living thing on the face of all the earth , man and cattle and things moving on the face of the earth , and birds of the air , came to destruction : only Noah and those who were with him in the ark , were kept from death
And the waters were over the earth a hundred and fifty days.
And God kept Noah in mind, and all the living things and the cattle which were with him in the ark: and God sent a wind over the earth, and the waters went down.
And the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were shut, and the rain from heaven was stopped.
And the waters went slowly back from the earth, and at the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters were lower.
And on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
And still the waters went on falling, till on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains were seen.
Then, after forty days, through the open window of the ark which he had made,
Noah sent out a raven, which went this way and that till the waters were gone from the earth.
And he sent out a dove, to see if the waters had gone from the face of the earth;
But the dove saw no resting-place for her foot, and came back to the ark, for the waters were still over all the earth; and he put out his hand, and took her into the ark.
And after waiting another seven days, he sent the dove out again;
And the dove came back at evening, and in her mouth was an olive-leaf broken off: so Noah was certain that the waters had gone down on the earth.
And after seven days more, he sent the dove out again, but she did not come back to him.
And in the six hundred and first year, on the first day of the first month, the waters were dry on the earth: and Noah took the cover off the ark and saw that the face of the earth was dry.
And on the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was dry.
And God said to Noah,
Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons' wives.
Take out with you every living thing which is with you, birds and cattle and everything which goes on the earth, so that they may have offspring and be fertile and be increased on the earth.
And Noah went out with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives;
And every beast and bird and every living thing of every sort which goes on the earth, went out of the ark.
And Noah made an altar to the Lord, and from every clean beast and bird he made burned offerings on the altar.
And when the sweet smell came up to the Lord , he said in his heart , I will not again put a curse on the earth because of man , for the thoughts of man ' s heart are evil from his earliest days ; never again will I
send destruction on all living things as I have done .
While the earth goes on, seed time and the getting in of the grain, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, will not come to an end.
And God gave his blessing to Noah and his sons, and said, Be fertile, and have increase, and make the earth full.
And the fear of you will be strong in every beast of the earth and every bird of the air; everything which goes on the land, and all the fishes of the sea, are given into your hands.
Every living and moving thing will be food for you; I give them all to you as before I gave you all green things.
But flesh with the life-blood in it you may not take for food.
And for your blood, which is your life, will I take payment; from every beast I will take it, and from every man will I take payment for the blood of his brother-man.
Whoever takes a man's life, by man will his life be taken; because God made man in his image.
And now, be fertile and have increase; have offspring on the earth and become great in number.
And God said to Noah and to his sons,
Truly, I will make my agreement with you and with your seed after you,
And with every living thing with you, all birds and cattle and every beast of the earth which comes out of the ark with you.
And I will make my agreement with you; never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters; never again will the waters come over all the earth for its destruction.
And God said, This is the sign of the agreement which I make between me and you and every living thing with you, for all future generations:
I will put my bow in the cloud and it will be for a sign of the agreement between me and the earth.
And whenever I make a cloud come over the earth, the bow will be seen in the cloud,
And I will keep in mind the agreement between me and you and every living thing; and never again will there be a great flow of waters causing destruction to all flesh.
And the bow will be in the cloud, and looking on it, I will keep in mind the eternal agreement between God and every living thing on the earth.
And God said to Noah, This is the sign of the agreement which I have made between me and all flesh on the earth.
And the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is the father of Canaan.
These three were the sons of Noah and from them all the earth was peopled.
In those days Noah became a farmer, and he made a vine-garden.
And he took of the wine of it and was overcome by drink; and he was uncovered in his tent.
And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father unclothed, and gave news of it to his two brothers outside.
And Shem and Japheth took a robe, and putting it on their backs went in with their faces turned away, and put it over their father so that they might not see him unclothed.
And, awaking from his wine, Noah saw what his youngest son had done to him, and he said,
Cursed be Canaan; let him be a servant of servants to his brothers.
And he said, Praise to the Lord, the God of Shem; let Canaan be his servant.
May God make Japheth great, and let his living-place be in the tents of Shem, and let Canaan be his servant.
And Noah went on living three hundred and fifty years after the great flow of waters;
all the years of his life were nine hundred and fifty: and he came to his end.
The word which Habakkuk the prophet saw.
How long, O Lord, will your ears be shut to my voice? I make an outcry to you about violent behaviour, but you do not send salvation.
Why do you make me see evil-doing, and why are my eyes fixed on wrong? for wasting and violent acts are before me: and there is fighting and bitter argument.
For this reason the law is feeble and decisions are not effected: for the upright man is circled round by evil-doers; because of which right is twisted.
See among the nations, and take note, and be full of wonder: for in your days I am doing a work in which you will have no belief, even if news of it is given to you.
For see, I am sending the Chaldaeans, that bitter and quick-moving nation; who go through the wide spaces of the earth to get for themselves living-places which are not theirs.
They are greatly to be feared: their right comes from themselves.
And their horses are quicker than leopards and their horsemen more cruel than evening wolves; they come from far away, like an eagle in flight rushing on its food.
They are coming all of them with force; the direction of their faces is forward, the number of their prisoners is like the sands of the sea.
He makes little of kings, rulers are a sport to him; all the strong places are to be laughed at; for he makes earthworks and takes them.
Then his purpose will be changed, over-stepping the limit; he will make his strength his god.
Are you not eternal , O Lord my God , my Holy One ? for you there is no death . O Lord , he has been ordered by you for our punishment ; and by you , O Rock , he has been marked out to put us right
Before your holy eyes sin may not be seen , and you are unable to put up with wrong ; why , then , are your eyes on the false ? why do you say nothing when the evil-doer puts an end to one who is more upright than himself
He has made men like the fishes of the sea, like the worms which have no ruler over them.
He takes them all up with his hook, he takes them in his net, getting them together in his fishing-net: for which cause he is glad and full of joy.
For this reason he makes an offering to his net, burning perfume to his fishing-net; because by them he gets much food and his meat is fat.
For this cause his net is ever open, and there is no end to his destruction of the nations.
I will take my position and be on watch, placing myself on my tower, looking out to see what he will say to me, and what answer he will give to my protest.
And the Lord gave me an answer, and said, Put the vision in writing and make it clear on stones, so that the reader may go quickly.
For the vision is still for the fixed time , and it is moving quickly to the end , and it will not be false : even if it is slow in coming , go on waiting for it ; because it will certainly come , it will not be
kept back .
As for the man of pride, my soul has no pleasure in him; but the upright man will have life through his good faith.
A curse on the cruel and false one ! the man full of pride , who never has enough ; who makes his desires wide as the underworld ! he is like death ; he is never full , but he makes all nations come to him , getting all
peoples together to himself .
Will not all these take up a word of shame against him and a bitter saying against him, and say, A curse on him who goes on taking what is not his and is weighted down with the property of debtors!
Will not your creditors suddenly be moved against you, and your troublers get up from their sleep, and you will be to them like goods taken in war?
Because you have taken their goods from great nations, all the rest of the peoples will take your goods from you; because of men's blood and violent acts against the land and the town and all who are living in it.
A curse on him who gets evil profits for his family, so that he may put his resting-place on high and be safe from the hand of the wrongdoer!
You have been a cause of shame to your house by cutting off a number of peoples, and sinning against your soul.
For the stone will give a cry out of the wall, and it will be answered by the board out of the woodwork.
A curse on him who is building a place with blood, and basing a town on evil-doing!
See, is it not the pleasure of the Lord of armies that the peoples are working for the fire and using themselves up for nothing?
For the earth will be full of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the sea is covered by the waters.
A curse on him who gives his neighbour the wine of his wrath, making him overcome with strong drink from the cup of his passion, so that you may be a witness of their shame!
You are full of shame in place of glory: take your part in the drinking, and let your shame be uncovered: the cup of the Lord's right hand will come round to you and your glory will be covered with shame.
For the violent acts against Lebanon will come on you, and the destruction of the cattle will be a cause of fear to you, because of men's blood and the violent acts against the land and the town and all who are living in it.
What profit is the pictured image to its maker? and as for the metal image, the false teacher, why does its maker put his faith in it, making false gods without a voice?
A curse on him who says to the wood, Awake! to the unbreathing stone, Up! let it be a teacher! See, it is plated with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all inside it.
But the Lord is in his holy Temple: let all the earth be quiet before him.
A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, put to Shigionoth.
O Lord, word of you has come to my ears; I have seen your work, O Lord; when the years come near make it clear; in wrath keep mercy in mind.
God came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. The heavens were covered with his glory, and the earth was full of his praise.
He was shining like the light; he had rays coming out from his hand: there his power was kept secret.
Before him went disease, and flames went out at his feet.
From his high place he sent shaking on the earth; he saw and nations were suddenly moved: and the eternal mountains were broken, the unchanging hills were bent down; his ways are eternal.
The curtains of Cushan were troubled, and the tents of Midian were shaking.
Was your wrath burning against the rivers? were you angry with the sea, that you went on your horses, on your war-carriages of salvation?
Your bow was quite uncovered. Selah. By you the earth was cut through with rivers.
The mountains saw you and were moved with fear; the clouds were streaming with water: the voice of the deep was sounding; the sun did not come up, and the moon kept still in her place.
At the light of your arrows they went away, at the shining of your polished spear.
You went stepping through the land in wrath, crushing the nations in your passion.
You went out for the salvation of your people, for the salvation of the one on whom your holy oil was put; wounding the head of the family of the evil-doer, uncovering the base even to the neck. Selah.
You have put your spears through his head, his horsemen were sent in flight like dry stems; they had joy in driving away the poor, in making a meal of them secretly.
The feet of your horses were on the sea, on the mass of great waters.
Hearing it , my inner parts were moved , and my lips were shaking at the sound ; my bones became feeble , and my steps were uncertain under me : I gave sounds of grief in the day of trouble , when his forces came up against the people
in bands .
For though the fig-tree has no flowers , and there is no fruit on the vine , and work on the olive comes to nothing , and the fields give no food ; and the flock is cut off from its resting-place , and there is no herd in the
cattle-house :
Still, I will be glad in the Lord, my joy will be in the God of my salvation.
The Lord God is my strength, and he makes my feet like roes' feet, guiding me on my high places. For the chief music-maker on corded instruments.
In the second year of Darius the king , in the sixth month , on the first day of the month , came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , ruler of Judah , and to Joshua , the son
of Jehozadak , the high priest , saying ,
These are the words of the Lord of armies: These people say, The time has not come for building the Lord's house.
Then the word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet, saying,
Is it a time for you to be living in roofed houses while this house is a waste?
For this cause the Lord of armies has said, Give thought to your ways.
Much has been planted , but little got in ; you take food , but have not enough ; you take drink , but are not full ; you are clothed , but no one is warm ; and he who gets payment for his work , gets it to
put it into a bag full of holes .
This is what the Lord of armies has said: Give thought to your ways.
Go up to the hills and get wood and put up the house; and I will take pleasure in it and be honoured, says the Lord.
You were looking for much , and it came to little ; and when you got it into your house , I took it away with a breath . Why ? says the Lord of armies . Because of my house which is a waste , while every man takes
care of the house which is his .
For this cause the heaven over you is kept from giving dew, and the earth from giving her fruit.
And by my order no rain came on the land or on the mountains or the grain or the wine or the oil or the produce of the earth or on men or cattle or on any work of man's hands.
Then Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , and Joshua , the son of Jehozadak , the high priest , and all the rest of the people , gave ear to the voice of the Lord their God and to the words of Haggai the prophet , because the Lord
their God had sent him , and the people were in fear before the Lord .
Then Haggai, whom the Lord had sent to give his words to the people, said, I am with you, says the Lord.
And the spirit of Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , ruler of Judah , was moved by the Lord , as was the spirit of Joshua , the son of Jehozadak , the high priest , and the spirit of all the rest of the people ; and they
came and did work in the house of the Lord of armies , their God .
On the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.
In the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet, saying,
Say now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, ruler of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the rest of the people,
Who is there still among you who saw this house in its first glory? and how do you see it now? is it not in your eyes as nothing?
But now be strong , O Zerubbabel , says the Lord ; and be strong , O Joshua , son of Jehozadak , the high priest ; and be strong , all you people of the land , says the Lord , and get to work : for I am
with you , says the Lord of armies :
The agreement which I made with you when you came out of Egypt, and my spirit, are with you still; have no fear.
For this is what the Lord of armies has said: In a short time I will make a shaking of the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land;
And I will make a shaking of all the nations, and the desired things of all nations will come: and I will make this house full of my glory, says the Lord of armies.
The silver is mine and the gold is mine, says the Lord of armies.
The second glory of this house will be greater than the first, says the Lord of armies: and in this place I will give peace, says the Lord of armies.
On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet, saying,
These are the words of the Lord of armies: Put now a point of law to the priests, saying,
If anyone has some holy flesh folded in the skirt of his robe, will bread or soup or wine or oil or any other food be made holy if touched by his skirt? And the priests answering said, No.
Then Haggai said, Will any of these be made unclean by the touch of one who is unclean through touching a dead body? And the priests answering said, It will be made unclean.
Then Haggai said, So is this people and so is this nation before me, says the Lord; and so is every work of their hands; and the offering they give there is unclean.
And now, give thought, looking back from this day to the time before one stone was put on another in the Temple of the Lord:
How, when anyone came to a store of twenty measures, there were only ten: when anyone went to the wine-store to get fifty vessels full, there were only twenty.
And I sent burning and wasting and a rain of ice-drops on all the works of your hands; but still you were not turned to me, says the Lord.
And now, give thought; looking on from this day, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the time when the base of the Lord's house was put in its place, give thought to it.
Is the seed still in the store-house? have the vine and the fig-tree, the pomegranate and the olive-tree, still not given their fruit? from this day I will send my blessing on you.
And the word of the Lord came a second time to Haggai, on the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,
Say to Zerubbabel, ruler of Judah, I will make a shaking of the heavens and the earth,
Overturning the power of kingdoms ; and I will send destruction on the strength of the kingdoms of the nations ; by me war-carriages will be overturned with those who are in them ; and the horses and the horsemen will come down , everyone by the sword of his
brother .
In that day , says the Lord of armies , I will take you , O Zerubbabel , my servant , the son of Shealtiel , says the Lord , and will make you as a jewelled ring : for I have taken you to be mine , says the
Lord of armies .
The word of the Lord which came to Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel.
The start of the word of the Lord by Hosea: And the Lord said to Hosea, Go, take for yourself a wife of loose ways, and children of the same, for the land has been untrue to the Lord.
So he took as his wife Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, and she gave birth to a son.
And the Lord said to him, Give him the name of Jezreel, for after a little time I will send punishment for the blood of Jezreel on the line of Jehu, and put an end to the kingdom of Israel.
And in that day I will let the bow of Israel be broken in the valley of Jezreel.
And after that she gave birth to a daughter. And the Lord said, Give her the name Lo-ruhamah; for I will not again have mercy on Israel, to give them forgiveness.
But I will have mercy on Judah and will give them salvation by the Lord their God, but not by the bow or the sword or by fighting or by horses or horsemen.
Now when Lo-ruhamah had been taken from the breast, the woman gave birth to a son.
And the Lord said, Give him the name Lo-ammi; for you are not my people, and I will not be your God.
But still the number of the children of Israel will be like the sand of the sea , which may not be measured or numbered ; and in place of its being said to them , You are not my people , it will be said to them , You
are the sons of the living God
And the children of Israel and the children of Judah will come together and take for themselves one head, and will go up from the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel.
Israel is a branching vine, full of fruit; as his fruit is increased, so the number of his altars is increased; as the land is fair, so they have made fair pillars.
Their mind is taken away; now they will be made waste: he will have their altars broken down, he will give their pillars to destruction.
Now, truly, they will say, We have no king, we have no fear of the Lord; and the king, what is he able to do for us?
Their words are foolish; they make agreements with false oaths, so punishment will come up like a poison-plant in a ploughed field.
The people of Samaria will be full of fear because of the ox of Beth-aven; its people will have sorrow for it, and its priests will give cries of grief for its glory, for the glory has gone in flight.
And they will take it to Assyria and give it to the great king; shame will come on Ephraim, and Israel will be shamed because of its image.
As for Samaria, her king is cut off, like mist on the water.
And the high places of Aven , the sin of Israel , will come to destruction ; thorns and waste plants will come up on their altars ; they will say to the mountains , Be a cover over us ; and to the hills , Come down on us
O Israel, you have done evil from the days of Gibeah; there they took up their position, so that the fighting against the children of evil might not overtake them in Gibeah.
I will come and give them punishment; and the peoples will come together against them when I give them the reward of their two sins.
And Ephraim is a trained cow , taking pleasure in crushing the grain ; but I have put a yoke on her fair neck ; I will put a horseman on the back of Ephraim ; Judah will be working the plough , Jacob will be turning up the earth
Put in the seed of righteousness, get in your grain in mercy, let your unploughed earth be turned up: for it is time to make search for the Lord, till he comes and sends righteousness on you like rain.
You have been ploughing sin, you have got in a store of evil, the fruit of deceit has been your food: for you put faith in your way, in the number of your men of war.
So a great outcry will go up from among your people, and all your strong places will be broken, as Beth-arbel was broken by Shalman in the day of war, as the mother was broken on the rocks with her children.
So will Beth-el do to you because of your evil-doing; at dawn will the king of Israel be cut off completely.
When Israel was a child he was dear to me; and I took my son out of Egypt.
When I sent for them, then they went away from me; they made offerings to the Baals, burning perfumes to images.
But I was guiding Ephraim's footsteps; I took them up in my arms, but they were not conscious that I was ready to make them well.
I made them come after me with the cords of a man, with the bands of love; I was to them as one who took the yoke from off their mouths, putting meat before them.
He will go back to the land of Egypt and the Assyrian will be his king, because they would not come back to me.
And the sword will go through his towns, wasting his children and causing destruction because of their evil designs.
My people are given up to sinning against me; though their voice goes up on high, no one will be lifting them up.
How may I give you up , O Ephraim ? how may I be your saviour , O Israel ? how may I make you like Admah ? how may I do to you as I did to Zeboim ? My heart is turned in me , it is soft
with pity .
I will not put into effect the heat of my wrath; I will not again send destruction on Ephraim; for I am God and not man, the Holy One among you; I will not put an end to you.
They will go after the Lord; his cry will be like that of a lion; his cry will be loud, and the children will come from the west, shaking with fear;
Shaking with fear like a bird, they will come out of Egypt, like a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will give them rest in their houses, says the Lord.
The deceit of Ephraim and the false words of Israel are about me on every side. ...
Ephraim's food is the wind, and he goes after the east wind: deceit and destruction are increasing day by day; they make an agreement with Assyria, and take oil into Egypt.
The Lord has a cause against Judah, and will give punishment to Jacob for his ways; he will give him the reward of his acts.
In the body of his mother he took his brother by the foot, and in his strength he was fighting with God;
He had a fight with the angel and overcame him; he made request for grace to him with weeping; he came face to face with him in Beth-el and there his words came to him;
Even the Lord, the God of armies; the Lord is his name.
So then, come back to your God; keep mercy and right, and be waiting at all times on your God.
As for Canaan, the scales of deceit are in his hands; he takes pleasure in twisted ways.
And Ephraim said, Now I have got wealth and much property; in all my works no sin may be seen in me.
But I am the Lord your God from the land of Egypt; I will give you tents for your living-places again as in the days of the holy meeting.
My word came to the ears of the prophets and I gave them visions in great number, and by the mouths of the prophets I made use of comparisons.
In Gilead there is evil. They are quite without value; in Gilgal they make offerings of oxen; truly their altars are like masses of stones in the hollows of a ploughed field.
And Jacob went in flight into the field of Aram, and Israel became a servant for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.
And by a prophet the Lord made Israel come up out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was kept safe.
I have been bitterly moved to wrath by Ephraim; so that his blood will be on him, and the Lord will make his shame come back on him.
When the words of my law came from Ephraim, he was lifted up in Israel; but when he did evil through the Baal, death overtook him.
And now their sins are increased ; they have made themselves a metal image , false gods from their silver , after their designs , all of them the work of the metal-workers ; they say of them , Let them give offerings , let men give kisses to the
oxen .
So they will be like the morning cloud, like the dew which goes early away, like the dust of the grain which the wind is driving out of the crushing-floor, like smoke going up from the fireplace.
But I am the Lord your God, from the land of Egypt; you have knowledge of no other God and there is no saviour but me.
I had knowledge of you in the waste land where no water was.
When I gave them food they were full, and their hearts were full of pride, and they did not keep me in mind.
So I will be like a lion to them; as a cruel beast I will keep watch by the road;
I will come face to face with them like a bear whose young ones have been taken from her, and their inmost hearts will be broken; there the dogs will make a meal of them; they will be wounded by the beasts of the field.
I have sent destruction on you, O Israel; who will be your helper?
Where is your king, that he may be your saviour? and all your rulers, that they may take up your cause? of whom you said, Give me a king and rulers.
I have given you a king, because I was angry, and have taken him away in my wrath.
The wrongdoing of Ephraim is shut up; his sin is put away in secret.
The pains of a woman in childbirth will come on him: he is an unwise son, for at this time it is not right for him to keep his place when children come to birth.
I will give the price to make them free from the power of the underworld, I will be their saviour from death: O death! where are your pains? O underworld! where is your destruction? my eyes will have no pity.
Though he gives fruit among his brothers , an east wind will come , the wind of the Lord coming up from the waste land , and his spring will become dry , his fountain will be without water : it will make waste the store of all the vessels
of his desire .
Samaria will be made waste, for she has gone against her God: they will be cut down by the sword, their little children will be broken on the rocks, their women who are with child will be cut open.
O Israel, come back to the Lord your God; for your evil-doing has been the cause of your fall.
Take with you words, and come back to the Lord; say to him, Let there be forgiveness for all wrongdoing, so that we may take what is good, and give in payment the fruit of our lips.
Assyria will not be our salvation; we will not go on horses; we will not again say to the work of our hands, You are our gods; for in you there is mercy for the child who has no father.
I will put right their errors; freely will my love be given to them, for my wrath is turned away from him.
I will be as the dew to Israel; he will put out flowers like a lily, and send out his roots like Lebanon.
His branches will be stretched out, he will be beautiful as the olive-tree and sweet-smelling as Lebanon.
They will come back and have rest in his shade; their life will be made new like the grain, and they will put out flowers like the vine; his name will be like the wine of Lebanon.
As for Ephraim, what has he to do with false gods any longer? I have given an answer and I will keep watch over him; I am like a branching fir-tree, from me comes your fruit.
He who is wise will see these things; he who has good sense will have knowledge of them. For the ways of the Lord are straight, and the upright will go in them, but sinners will be falling in them.
Say to your brothers, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.
Take up the cause against your mother, take it up, for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband; let her put away her loose ways from her face, and her false ways from between her breasts;
For fear that I may take away her robe from her, making her uncovered as in the day of her birth; making her like a waste place and a dry land, causing her death through need of water.
And I will have no mercy on her children, for they are the children of her loose ways.
For their mother has been untrue; she who gave them birth has done things of shame, for she said, I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my linen, my oil and my wine.
For this cause I will put thorns in her road, building up a wall round her so that she may not go on her way.
And if she goes after her lovers she will not overtake them; if she makes search for them she will not see them; then will she say, I will go back to my first husband, for then it was better for me than now.
For she had no knowledge that it was I who gave her the grain and the wine and the oil, increasing her silver and gold which they gave to the Baal.
So I will take away again my grain in its time and my wine, and I will take away my wool and my linen with which her body might have been covered.
And now I will make her shame clear before the eyes of her lovers, and no one will take her out of my hand.
And I will put an end to all her joy, her feasts, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, and all her regular meetings.
And I will make waste her vines and her fig-trees , of which she has said , These are the payments which my lovers have made to me ; and I will make them a waste of trees , and the beasts of the field will take them for food
And I will give her punishment for the days of the Baals, to whom she has been burning perfumes, when she made herself fair with her nose-rings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, giving no thought to me, says the Lord.
For this cause I will make her come into the waste land and will say words of comfort to her.
And I will give her vine-gardens from there , and the valley of Achor for a door of hope ; and she will give her answer there as in the days when she was young , and as in the time when she came up out of the land of
Egypt .
And in that day, says the Lord, you will say to me, Ishi; and you will never again give me the name of Baali;
For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and never again will she say their names.
And in that day I will make an agreement for them with the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven and the things which go low on the earth ; I will put an end to the bow and the sword and war in all the land ,
and will make them take their rest in peace .
And I will take you as my bride for ever; truly, I will take you as my bride in righteousness and in right judging, in love and in mercies.
I will take you as my bride in good faith, and you will have knowledge of the Lord.
And it will be, in that day, says the Lord, that I will give an answer to the heavens, and the heavens to the earth;
And the earth will give its answer to the grain and the wine and the oil, and they will give an answer to Jezreel;
And I will put her as seed in the earth, and I will have mercy on her to whom no mercy was given; and I will say to those who were not my people, You are my people, and they will say, My God.
And the Lord said to me, Give your love again to a woman who has a lover and is false to her husband, even as the Lord has love for the children of Israel, though they are turned to other gods and are lovers of grape-cakes.
So I got her for myself for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer and a half of barley;
And I said to her, You are to be mine for a long space of time; you are not to be false to me, and no other man is to have you for his wife; and so will I be to you.
For the children of Israel will for a long time be without king and without ruler, without offerings and without pillars, and without ephod or images.
And after that, the children of Israel will come back and go in search of the Lord their God and David their king; and they will come in fear to the Lord and to his mercies in the days to come.
Give ear to the word of the Lord, O children of Israel; for the Lord has a cause against the people of this land, because there is no good faith in it, and no mercy and no knowledge of God in the land.
There is cursing and broken faith, violent death and attacks on property, men are untrue in married life, houses are broken into, and there is blood touching blood.
Because of this the land will be dry, and everyone living in it will be wasted away, with the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven; even the fishes of the sea will be taken away.
Let no man go to law or make protests, for your people are like those who go to law with a priest.
You will not be able to keep on your feet by day, and by night the prophet will be falling down with you, and I will give your mother to destruction.
Destruction has overtaken my people because they have no knowledge ; because you have given up knowledge , I will give you up , so that you will be no priest to me , because you have not kept in mind the law of your God , I will not
keep your children in my memory .
Even while they were increasing in number they were sinning against me; I will let their glory be changed into shame.
The sin of my people is like food to them; and their desire is for their wrongdoing.
And the priest will be like the people; I will give them punishment for their evil ways, and the reward of their acts.
They will have food, but they will not be full; they will be false to me, but they will not be increased, because they no longer give thought to the Lord.
Loose ways and new wine take away wisdom.
My people get knowledge from their tree, and their rod gives them news; for a false spirit is the cause of their wandering, and they have been false to their God.
They make offerings on the tops of mountains, burning perfumes in high places, under trees of every sort, because their shade is good: and so your daughters are given up to loose ways and your brides are false to their husbands.
I will not give punishment to your daughters or your brides for their evil behaviour ; for they make themselves separate with loose women , and make offerings with those who are used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods : the people who have no wisdom will
be sent away .
Do not you, O Israel, come into error; do not you, O Judah, come to Gilgal, or go up to Beth-aven, or take an oath, By the living Lord.
For Israel is uncontrolled, like a cow which may not be controlled; now will the Lord give them food like a lamb in a wide place.
Ephraim is joined to false gods; let him be.
Their drink has become bitter; they are completely false; her rulers take pleasure in shame.
They are folded in the skirts of the wind; they will be shamed because of their offerings.
Give ear to this, O priests; give attention, O Israel, and you, family of the king; for you are to be judged; you have been a deceit at Mizpah and a net stretched out on Tabor.
They have gone deep in the evil ways of Shittim, but I am the judge of all.
I have knowledge of Ephraim, and Israel is not secret from me; for now, O Ephraim, you have been false to me, Israel has become unclean.
Their works will not let them come back to their God, for a false spirit is in them and they have no knowledge of the Lord.
And the pride of Israel gives an answer to his face; and Ephraim will have a fall through his sins, and the fall of Judah will be the same as theirs.
They will go, with their flocks and their herds, in search of the Lord, but they will not see him; he has taken himself out of their view.
They have been false to the Lord; they have given birth to strange children; now the new moon will make them waste with their fields.
Let the horn be sounded in Gibeah and in Ramah; give a loud cry in Beth-aven, They are after you, O Benjamin.
Ephraim will become a waste in the day of punishment; I have given knowledge among the tribes of Israel of what is certain.
The rulers of Judah are like those who take away a landmark; I will let loose my wrath on them like flowing water.
Ephraim is troubled; he is crushed by his judges, because he took pleasure in walking after deceit.
And so to Ephraim I am like a wasting insect, and a destruction to the children of Judah.
When Ephraim saw his disease and Judah his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria and sent to the great king; but he is not able to make you well or give you help for your wound.
For I will be to Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the children of Judah; I, even I, will give him wounds and go away; I will take him away, and there will be no helper.
I will go back to my place till they are made waste; in their trouble they will go after me early and will make search for me.
Come, let us go back to the Lord; for he has given us wounds and he will make us well; he has given blows and he will give help.
After two days he will give us life, and on the third day he will make us get up, and we will be living before him.
And let us have knowledge, let us go after the knowledge of the Lord; his going out is certain as the dawn, his decisions go out like the light; he will come to us like the rain, like the spring rain watering the earth.
O Ephraim, what am I to do to you? O Judah, what am I to do to you? For your love is like a morning cloud, and like the dew which goes early away.
So I have had it cut in stones; I gave them teaching by the words of my mouth;
Because my desire is for mercy and not offerings; for the knowledge of God more than for burned offerings.
But like a man, they have gone against the agreement; there they were false to me.
Gilead is a town of evil-doers, marked with blood.
And like a band of thieves waiting for a man, so are the priests watching secretly the way of those going quickly to Shechem, for they are working with an evil design.
In Israel I have seen a very evil thing; there false ways are seen in Ephraim, Israel is unclean;
And Judah has put up disgusting images for himself.
When my desire was for the fate of my people to be changed and to make Israel well , then the sin of Ephraim was made clear , and the evil-doing of Samaria ; for their ways are false , and the thief comes into the house , while the
band of outlaws takes property by force in the streets .
And they do not say to themselves that I keep in mind all their sin; now their evil acts come round them on every side; they are before my face.
In their sin they make a king for themselves, and rulers in their deceit.
They are all untrue; they are like a burning oven; the bread-maker does not make up the fire from the time when the paste is mixed till it is leavened.
On the day of our king, the rulers made him ill with the heat of wine; his hand was stretched out with the men of pride.
For they have made their hearts ready like an oven, while they are waiting secretly; their wrath is sleeping all night; in the morning it is burning like a flaming fire.
They are all heated like an oven, and they put an end to their judges; all their kings have been made low; not one among them makes prayer to me.
Ephraim is mixed with the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.
Men from other lands have made waste his strength, and he is not conscious of it; grey hairs have come on him here and there, and he has no knowledge of it.
And the pride of Israel gives an answer to his face; but for all this, they have not gone back to the Lord their God, or made search for him.
And Ephraim is like a foolish dove, without wisdom; they send out their cry to Egypt, they go to Assyria.
When they go, my net will be stretched out over them; I will take them like the birds of heaven, I will give them punishment, I will take them away in the net for their sin.
May trouble be theirs! for they have gone far away from me; and destruction, for they have been sinning against me; I was ready to be their saviour, but they said false words against me.
And they have not made prayer to me in their hearts, but they make loud cries on their beds; they are cutting themselves for food and wine, they are turned against me.
Though I have given training and strength to their arms, they have evil designs against me.
They have gone to what is of no value; they are like a false bow; their captains will come to destruction by the sword, and their ruler by my wrath; for this, the land of Egypt will make sport of them.
Put the horn to your mouth. He comes like an eagle against the house of the Lord; because they have gone against my agreement, they have not kept my law.
They will send up to me a cry for help: We, Israel, have knowledge of you, O God of Israel.
Israel has given up what is good; his haters will go after him.
They have put up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, but I had no knowledge of it; they have made images of silver and gold, so that they may be cut off.
I will have nothing to do with your young ox, O Samaria; my wrath is burning against them; how long will it be before the children of Israel make themselves clean?
The workman made it, it is no god; the ox of Samaria will be broken into bits.
For they have been planting the wind, and their fruit will be the storm; his grain has no stem, it will give no meal, and if it does, a strange nation will take it.
Israel has come to destruction; now they are among the nations like a cup in which there is no pleasure.
For they have gone up to Assyria like an ass going by himself; Ephraim has given money to get lovers.
But though they give money to the nations for help, still I will send them in all directions; and in a short time they will be without a king and rulers.
Because Ephraim has been increasing altars for sin, altars have become a cause of sin to him.
Though I put my law in writing for him in ten thousand rules, they are to him as a strange thing.
He gives the offerings of his lovers, and takes the flesh for food; but the Lord has no pleasure in them; now he will keep in mind their evil-doing and give them the punishment of their sins; they will go back to Egypt.
For Israel has no memory of his Maker, and has put up the houses of kings; and Judah has made great the number of his walled towns. But I will send a fire on his towns and put an end to his great houses.
Have no joy, O Israel, and do not be glad like the nations; for you have been untrue to your God; your desire has been for the loose woman's reward on every grain-floor.
The grain-floor and the place where the grapes are crushed will not give them food; there will be no new wine for them.
They will have no resting-place in the Lord's land, but Ephraim will go back to Egypt, and they will take unclean food in Assyria.
They will give no wine offering to the Lord , they will not make offerings ready for him ; their bread will be like the bread of those in sorrow ; all who take it will be unclean , because their bread will be only for their desire , it
will not come into the house of the Lord .
What will you do on the day of worship, and on the day of the feast of the Lord?
For see, they are going away into Assyria; Egypt will get them together, Memphis will be their last resting-place; their fair silver vessels will be covered over with field plants, and thorns will come up in their tents.
The days of punishment, the days of reward are come; Israel will be put to shame; the prophet is foolish, the man who has the spirit is off his head, because of your great sin.
There is great hate against the watchman of Ephraim, the people of my God; as for the prophet, there is a net in all his ways, and hate in the house of his God.
They have gone deep in evil as in the days of Gibeah; he will keep in mind their wrongdoing, he will give them punishment for their sins.
I made discovery of Israel as of grapes in the waste land ; I saw your fathers as the first-fruits of the fig-tree in her early fruit time ; but they came to Baal-peor , and made themselves holy to the thing of shame , and became disgusting like that
to which they gave their love .
As for Ephraim, their glory will go in flight like a bird: there will be no birth and no one with child and no giving of life.
Even though their children have come to growth I will take them away, so that not a man will be there; for their evil-doing will be complete and they will be put to shame because of it.
As I have seen a beast whose young have been taken from her, so Ephraim will give birth to children only for them to be put to death.
O Lord, what will you give them? Give them bodies which may not give birth and breasts without milk.
All their evil-doing is in Gilgal; there I had hate for them; because of their evil-doing I will send them out of my house; they will no longer be dear to me; all their rulers are uncontrolled.
The rod has come on Ephraim, their root is dry, let them have no fruit; even though they give birth, I will put to death the dearest fruit of their bodies.
My God will give them up because they did not give ear to him; they will be wandering among the nations.
The vision of Isaiah, the son of Amoz, which he saw about Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
Give ear, O heavens, and you, O earth, to the word which the Lord has said: I have taken care of my children till they became men, but their hearts have been turned away from me.
Even the ox has knowledge of its owner, and the ass of the place where its master puts its food: but Israel has no knowledge, my people give no thought to me.
O nation full of sin, a people weighted down with crime, a generation of evil-doers, false-hearted children: they have gone away from the Lord, they have no respect for the Holy One of Israel, their hearts are turned back from him.
Why will you have more and more punishment? why keep on in your evil ways? Every head is tired and every heart is feeble.
The body, from head to foot, is all diseased; it is a mass of open wounds, marks of blows, and broken flesh: the flow of blood has not been stopped, and no oil has been put on the wounds.
Your country has become waste; your towns are burned with fire; as for your land, it is overturned before your eyes, made waste and overcome by men from strange lands.
And the daughter of Zion has become like a tent in a vine-garden, like a watchman's house in a field of fruit, like a town shut in by armies.
If the Lord of armies had not kept some at least of us safe, we would have been like Sodom, and the fate of Gomorrah would have been ours.
Give ear to the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom; let your hearts be turned to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.
What use to me is the number of the offerings which you give me ? says the Lord ; your burned offerings of sheep , and the best parts of fat cattle , are a weariness to me ; I take no pleasure in the blood of oxen , or
of lambs , or of he-goats .
At whose request do you come before me, making my house unclean with your feet?
Give me no more false offerings; the smoke of burning flesh is disgusting to me, so are your new moons and Sabbaths and your holy meetings.
Your new moons and your regular feasts are a grief to my soul: they are a weight in my spirit; I am crushed under them.
And when your hands are stretched out to me, my eyes will be turned away from you: even though you go on making prayers, I will not give ear: your hands are full of blood.
Be washed, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; let there be an end of sinning;
Take pleasure in well-doing; let your ways be upright, keep down the cruel, give a right decision for the child who has no father, see to the cause of the widow.
Come now, and let us have an argument together, says the Lord: how may your sins which are red like blood be white as snow? how may their dark purple seem like wool?
If you will give ear to my word and do it, the good things of the land will be yours;
But if your hearts are turned against me, I will send destruction on you by the sword; so the Lord has said.
The upright town has become untrue; there was a time when her judges gave right decisions, when righteousness had a resting-place in her, but now she is full of those who take men's lives.
Your silver is no longer true metal, your wine is mixed with water.
Your chiefs have gone against the Lord , they have become friends of thieves ; every one of them is looking for profit and going after rewards ; they do not give right decisions for the child who has no father , and they do not let the cause of
the widow come before them .
For this reason the Lord, the Lord of armies, the Strong One of Israel, has said, I will put an end to my haters, and send punishment on those who are against me;
And my hand will again be on you, washing away what is unclean as with soap, and taking away all your false metal;
And I will give you judges again as at the first, and wise guides as in the past; then you will be named, The Town of Righteousness, the true town.
Upright acts will be the price of Zion's forgiveness, and by righteousness will men be living there.
But a common destruction will overtake sinners and evil-doers together, and those who have gone away from the Lord will be cut off.
For you will be put to shame because of the trees of your desire, and because of the gardens of your pleasure.
For you will be like a tree whose leaves have become dry, and like a garden without water.
And the strong will be as food for the fire, and his work as a flame; and they will be burned together, with no one to put out the fire.
Cursed are those who make evil decisions, and the writers who make the records of their cruel acts:
Who do wrong to the poor in their cause, and take away the right of the crushed among my people, so that they may have the property of widows, and get under their power those who have no father.
And what will you do in the day of punishment, and in the destruction which is coming from far? to whom will you go for help, and what will become of your glory?
... For all this his wrath is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
Ho! Assyrian, the rod of my wrath, the instrument of my punishment!
I will send him against a nation of wrongdoers, and against the people of my wrath I will give him orders, to take their wealth in war, crushing them down like the dust in the streets.
But this is not what is in his mind, and this is not his design; but his purpose is destruction, and the cutting off of more and more nations.
For he says, Are not all my captains kings?
Will not the fate of Calno be like that of Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?
As my hand has come on the kingdoms of the images, whose pictured images were more in number than those of Jerusalem and Samaria;
So, as I have done to Samaria and her images, I will do to Jerusalem and her images.
For this cause it will be that, when the purpose of the Lord against Mount Zion and Jerusalem is complete, I will send punishment on the pride of the heart of the king of Assyria, and on the glory of his uplifted eyes.
For he has said , By the strength of my hand I have done it , and by my knowledge , for I am wise : and I have taken away the limits of the peoples ' lands , and the stores of their wealth have become mine ; and
I have made towns low in the dust , sending destruction on those living in them ;
And I have put my hands on the wealth of the peoples , as on the place where a bird has put her eggs ; and as a man may take the eggs from which a bird has gone , so I have taken all the earth for myself :
and not a wing was moved , and not a mouth gave out a sound .
Will the axe say high-sounding words against him who is using it , or the blade be full of pride against him who is cutting with it ? As if a rod had the power of shaking him who is using it , or as if a stick might take
up him who is not wood .
For this cause the Lord, the Lord of armies, will make his fat become wasted; and in his inner parts a fire will be lighted like a burning flame.
And the light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: wasting and burning up his thorns in one day.
And he will put an end to the glory of his woods and of his planted fields, soul and body together; and it will be as when a man is wasted by disease.
And the rest of the trees of his wood will be small in number, so that a child may put them down in writing.
And it will be in that day that the rest of Israel , and those of Jacob who have come safely through these troubles , will no longer go for help to him whose rod was on their back , but their faith will be in the Lord , the
Holy One of Israel .
The rest, even the rest of Jacob, will come back to the Strong God.
For though your people, O Israel, are as the sand of the sea, only a small number will come back: for the destruction is fixed, overflowing in righteousness.
For the Lord, the Lord of armies, is about to make destruction complete in all the land.
For this cause the Lord, the Lord of armies, says, O my people living in Zion, have no fear of the Assyrian, even if his rod comes on your back, and his stick is lifted up as in Egypt.
For in a very short time my passion will be over, and my wrath will be turned to their destruction.
And the Lord of armies will be shaking a whip against him, as when he overcame Midian at the rock of Oreb: and his rod will be lifted up against them as it was against the Egyptians.
And in that day the weight which he put on your back will be taken away, and his yoke broken from off your neck.
He has gone up from Pene-Rimmon, he has come to Aiath; he has gone past Migron, at Michmash he puts his forces in order.
They have gone across the mountain; Geba will be our resting-place tonight, they say: Ramah is shaking with fear; Gibeah of Saul has gone in flight.
Give a loud cry, daughter of Gallim; let Laishah give ear; let Anathoth give answer to her.
Madmenah has gone; the men of Gebim are putting their goods in a safe place.
This very day he is stopping at Nob; he is shaking his hand against the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
See, the Lord, the Lord of armies, is cutting off his branches with a great noise, and his strong ones are falling and his high ones are coming down.
And he is cutting down the thick places of the wood with an axe, and Lebanon with its tall trees is coming down.
And there will come a rod out of the broken tree of Jesse, and a branch out of his roots will give fruit.
And the spirit of the Lord will be resting on him, the spirit of wisdom and good sense, the spirit of wise guiding and strength, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;
And he will not be guided in his judging by what he sees, or give decisions by the hearing of his ears:
But he will do right in the cause of the poor , and give wise decisions for those in the land who are in need ; and the rod of his mouth will come down on the cruel , and with the breath of his lips he will put an
end to the evil-doer .
And righteousness will be the cord of his robe, and good faith the band round his breast.
And the wolf will be living with the lamb , and the leopard will take his rest with the young goat ; and the lion will take grass for food like the ox ; and the young lion will go with the young ones of the herd ; and a
little child will be their guide .
And the cow and the bear will be friends while their young ones are sleeping together.
And the child at the breast will be playing by the hole of the snake, and the older child will put his hand on the bright eye of the poison-snake.
There will be no cause of pain or destruction in all my holy mountain: for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the sea is covered by the waters.
And in that day, the eyes of the nations will be turned to the root of Jesse which will be lifted up as the flag of the peoples; and his resting-place will be glory.
And in that day the hand of the Lord will be stretched out the second time to get back the rest of his people , from Assyria , and from Egypt , and from Pathros , and from Cush , and from Elam , and from Shinar , and from
Hamath , and from the sea-lands .
And he will put up a flag as a sign to the nations, and he will get together those of Israel who had been sent away, and the wandering ones of Judah, from the four ends of the earth.
And the envy of Ephraim will be gone, and those who make trouble for Judah will come to an end: Ephraim will have no more envy of Judah, and there will be an end of Judah's hate for Ephraim.
And they will be united in attacking the Philistines on the west, and together they will take the goods of the children of the east: their hand will be on Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon will be under their rule.
And the Lord will make the tongue of the Egyptian sea completely dry; and with his burning wind his hand will be stretched out over the River, and it will be parted into seven streams, so that men may go over it with dry feet.
And there will be a highway for the rest of his people from Assyria; as there was for Israel in the day when he came up out of the land of Egypt.
And in that day you will say I will give praise to you, O Lord; for though you were angry with me, your wrath is turned away, and I am comforted.
See, God is my salvation; I will have faith in the Lord, without fear: for the Lord Jah is my strength and song; and he has become my salvation.
So with joy will you get water out of the springs of salvation.
And in that day you will say, Give praise to the Lord, let his name be honoured, give word of his doings among the peoples, say that his name is lifted up.
Make a song to the Lord; for he has done noble things: give news of them through all the earth.
Let your voice be sounding in a cry of joy, O daughter of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel among you.
The word of the Lord about Babylon which Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw.
Put up a flag on a clear mountain-top, make a loud outcry to them, give directions with the hand, so that they may go into the doors of the great ones.
I have given orders to my holy ones, I have sent out my men of war, those of mine who take pride in their power, to give effect to my wrath.
The noise of great numbers in the mountains, like the noise of a strong people! The noise of the kingdoms of the nations meeting together! The Lord of armies is numbering his forces for war.
They come from a far country, from the farthest part of heaven, even the Lord and the instruments of his wrath, with destruction for all the land.
Send out a cry of grief; for the day of the Lord is near; it comes as destruction from the Most High.
For this cause all hands will be feeble, and every heart of man be turned to water;
Their hearts will be full of fear; pains and sorrows will overcome them; they will be in pain like a woman in childbirth; they will be shocked at one another; their faces will be like flames.
See, the day of the Lord is coming, cruel, with wrath and burning passion: to make the land a waste, driving the sinners in it to destruction.
For the stars of heaven and its bright armies will not give their light: the sun will be made dark in his journey through the heaven, and the moon will keep back her light.
And I will send punishment on the world for its evil, and on the sinners for their wrongdoing; and I will put an end to all pride, and will make low the power of the cruel.
I will make men so small in number, that a man will be harder to get than gold, even the best gold of Ophir.
For this cause the heavens will be shaking, and the earth will be moved out of its place, in the wrath of the Lord of armies, and in the day of his burning passion.
And it will be that, like a roe in flight, and like wandering sheep, they will go every man to his people and to his land.
Everyone who is overtaken will have a spear put through him, and everyone who goes in flight will be put to the sword.
Their young children will be broken up before their eyes; their goods will be taken away, and their wives made the property of others.
See, I am driving the Medes against them, who put no value on silver and have no pleasure in gold.
In their hands are bows and spears; they are cruel, violently putting the young men to death, and crushing the young women; they have no pity for children, and no mercy for the fruit of the body.
And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beautiful town which is the pride of the Chaldaeans, will be like God's destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.
People will never be living in it again, and it will have no more men from generation to generation: the Arab will not put up his tent there; and those who keep sheep will not make it a resting-place for their flocks.
But the beasts of the waste land will have their holes there; and the houses will be full of crying jackals, and ostriches will have their place there, and evil spirits will be dancing there.
And wolves will be answering one another in their towers, and jackals in their houses of pleasure: her time is near, and her days of power will quickly be ended.
For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will again make Israel his special people, and will put them in their land; and the man from a strange country will take his place among them and be joined to the family of Jacob.
And the people will take them with them to their place: and the children of Israel will give them a heritage in the Lord's land as men-servants and women-servants, making them prisoners whose prisoners they were; and they will be rulers over their masters.
And it will be, in the day when the Lord gives you rest from your sorrow, and from your trouble, and from the hard yoke which they had put on you,
That you will take up this bitter song against the king of Babylon, and say, How has the cruel overseer come to an end! He who was lifted up in pride is cut off;
The stick of the evil-doers, the rod of the rulers, is broken by the Lord;
He whose rod was on the peoples with an unending wrath, ruling the nations in passion, with an uncontrolled rule.
All the earth is at rest and is quiet: they are bursting into song.
Even the trees of the wood are glad over you, the trees of Lebanon, saying, From the time of your fall no wood-cutter has come up against us with an axe.
The underworld is moved at your coming: the shades of the dead are awake before you, even the strong ones of the earth; all the kings of the world have got up from their seats.
They all make answer and say to you, Have you become feeble like us? have you been made even as we are?
Your pride has gone down into the underworld, and the noise of your instruments of music; the worms are under you, and your body is covered with them.
How great is your fall from heaven, O shining one, son of the morning! How are you cut down to the earth, low among the dead bodies!
For you said in your heart, I will go up to heaven, I will make my seat higher than the stars of God; I will take my place on the mountain of the meeting-place of the gods, in the inmost parts of the north.
I will go higher than the clouds; I will be like the Most High.
But you will come down to the underworld, even to its inmost parts.
Those who see you will be looking on you with care, they will be in deep thought, saying, Is this the troubler of the earth, the shaker of kingdoms?
Who made the world a waste, overturning its towns; who did not let his prisoners loose from the prison-house.
All the kings of the earth are at rest in glory, every man in his house,
But you , like a birth before its time , are stretched out with no resting-place in the earth ; clothed with the bodies of the dead who have been put to the sword , who go down to the lowest parts of the underworld ; a dead body ,
crushed under foot .
As for your fathers, you will not be united with them in their resting-place, because you have been the cause of destruction to your land, and of death to your people; the seed of the evil-doer will have no place in the memory of man.
Make ready a place of death for his children, because of the evil-doing of their father; so that they may not come up and take the earth for their heritage, covering the face of the world with waste places.
For I will come up against them, says the Lord of armies, cutting off from Babylon name and offspring, son and son's son, says the Lord.
And I will make you a heritage for the hedgehog, and pools of water: and I will go through it with the brush of destruction, says the Lord of armies.
The Lord has taken an oath, saying, My design will certainly come about, and my purpose will be effected:
To let the Assyrian be broken in my land, and crushed under foot on my mountains: there will his yoke be taken away from them, and his rule over them come to an end.
This is the purpose for all the earth: and this is the hand stretched out over all nations.
For it is the purpose of the Lord of armies, and who will make it of no effect? when his hand is stretched out, by whom may it be turned back?
In the year of the death of King Ahaz this word came to the prophet:
Be not glad, O Philistia, all of you, because the rod which was on you is broken: for out of the snake's root will come a poison-snake, and its fruit will be a winged poison-snake.
And the poorest of the land will have food, and those in need will be given a safe resting-place: but your seed will come to an end for need of food, and the rest of you will be put to the sword.
Send out a cry, O door! Make sounds of sorrow, O town! All your land has come to nothing, O Philistia; for there comes a smoke out of the north, and everyone keeps his place in the line.
What answer, then, will my people give to the representatives of the nation? That the Lord is the builder of Zion, and she will be a safe place for the poor of his people.
The word about Moab. For in a night Ar of Moab has become waste, and is seen no longer; for in a night Kir of Moab has become waste, and is seen no longer.
The daughter of Dibon has gone up to the high places, weeping: Moab is sounding her cry of sorrow over Nebo, and over Medeba: everywhere the hair of the head and of the face is cut off.
In their streets they are covering themselves with haircloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their public places, there is crying and bitter weeping.
Heshbon is crying out, and Elealeh; their voice is sounding even to Jahaz: for this cause the heart of Moab is shaking; his soul is shaking with fear.
My heart is crying out for Moab; her people go in flight to Zoar, and to Eglath-shelishiyah: for they go up with weeping by the slope of Luhith; on the way to Horonaim they send up a cry of destruction.
The waters of Nimrim will become dry: for the grass is burned up, the young grass is coming to an end, every green thing is dead.
For this cause they will take away their wealth, and the stores they have got together, over the stream of the water-plants.
For the cry has gone round the limits of Moab; as far as to Eglaim and Beer-elim.
For the waters of Dimon are full of blood: and I'm sending even more on Moab, a lion on those of Moab who go in flight, and on the rest of the land.
And they will send ... to the mountain of the daughter of Zion.
For the daughters of Moab will be like wandering birds, like a place from which the young birds have gone in flight, at the ways across the Arnon.
Give wise directions, make a decision; let your shade be as night in full day: keep safe those who are in flight; do not give up the wandering ones.
Let those who have been forced out of Moab have a resting-place with you ; be a cover to them from him who is making waste their land : till the cruel ones are cut off , and wasting has come to an end , and those who take pleasure
in crushing the poor are gone from the land .
Then a king's seat will be based on mercy, and one will be seated on it in the tent of David for ever; judging uprightly, and quick to do righteousness.
We have had word of the pride of Moab, how great it is; how he is lifted up in pride and passion: his high words about himself are false.
For this cause everyone in Moab will give cries of grief for Moab: crushed to the earth, they will be weeping for the men of Kir-hareseth.
For the fields of Heshbon are waste , the vine of Sibmah is dead ; the lords of nations were overcome by the produce of her vines ; her vine-plants went as far as Jazer , and came even to the waste land ; her branches were stretched out to
the sea .
For this cause my sorrow for the vine of Sibmah will be like the weeping for Jazer: my eyes are dropping water on you, O Heshbon and Elealeh! For they are sounding the war-cry over your summer fruits and the getting in of your grain;
And all joy is gone; no longer are they glad for the fertile field; and in the vine-gardens there are no songs or sounds of joy: the crushing of grapes has come to an end, and its glad cry has been stopped.
For this cause the cords of my heart are sounding for Moab, and I am full of sorrow for Kir-heres.
And when Moab goes up to the high place, and makes prayer in the house of his god, it will have no effect.
This is the word which the Lord said about Moab in the past.
But now the Lord has said, In three years, the years of a servant working for payment, the glory of Moab, all that great people, will be turned to shame, and the rest of Moab will be very small and without honour.
The word about Damascus. See, they have made Damascus a town no longer; it has become a waste place.
Her towns are unpeopled for ever; there the flocks take their rest in peace, without fear.
The strong tower has gone from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus: the rest of Aram will come to destruction, and be made like the glory of the children of Israel, says the Lord of armies.
And it will be in that day that the glory of Jacob will be made small, and the strength of his body will become feeble.
And it will be like a man cutting the growth of his grain, pulling together the heads of the grain with his arm; even as when they get in the grain in the valley of Rephaim.
But it will be like a man shaking an olive-tree, something will still be there, two or three berries on the top of the highest branch, four or five on the outside branches of a fertile tree, says the Lord, the God of Israel.
In that day a man's heart will be turned to his Maker, and his eyes to the Holy One of Israel.
He will not be looking to the altars, the work of his hands, or to the wood pillars or to the sun-images which his fingers have made.
In that day your towns will be like the waste places of the Hivites and the Amorites which the children of Israel took for a heritage, and they will come to destruction.
For you have not given honour to the God of your salvation, and have not kept in mind the Rock of your strength; for this cause you made a garden of Adonis, and put in it the vine-cuttings of a strange god;
In the day of your planting you were watching its growth, and in the morning your seed was flowering: but its fruit is wasted away in the day of grief and bitter sorrow.
Ah! the voice of peoples, like the loud sounding of the seas, and the thundering of great nations rushing on like the bursting out of waters!
But he will put a stop to them, and make them go in flight far away, driving them like the waste of the grain on the tops of the mountains before the wind, and like the circling dust before the storm.
In the evening there is fear, and in the morning they are gone. This is the fate of those who take our goods, and the reward of those who violently take our property for themselves.
Ho! land of the sounding of wings, on the other side of the rivers of Ethiopia:
Which sends its representatives by the sea , even in ships of papyrus on the waters . Go back quickly , O representatives , to a nation tall and smooth , to a people causing fear through all their history ; a strong nation , crushing down its haters ,
whose land is cut through by rivers .
All you peoples of the world, and you who are living on the earth, when a flag is lifted up on the mountains, give attention; and when the horn is sounded, give ear.
For this is what the Lord has said to me: I will be quiet, watching from my place; like the clear heat when the sun is shining, like a mist of dew in the heat of summer.
For before the time of getting in the grapes, after the opening of the bud, when the flower has become a grape ready for crushing, he will take away the small branches with knives, cutting down and taking away the wide-stretching branches.
They will be for the birds of the mountains, and for the beasts of the earth: the birds will come down on them in the summer, and the beasts of the earth in the winter.
In that time an offering will be made to the Lord of armies from a people tall and smooth , causing fear through all their history ; a strong nation , crushing down its haters , whose land is cut through by rivers , an offering taken to the place
of the name of the Lord of armies , even Mount Zion .
The word about Egypt. See, the Lord is seated on a quick-moving cloud, and is coming to Egypt: and the false gods of Egypt will be troubled at his coming, and the heart of Egypt will be turned to water.
And I will send the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they will be fighting every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; town against town, and kingdom against kingdom.
And the spirit of Egypt will be troubled in her , and I will make her decisions without effect : and they will be turning to the false gods , and to those who make hollow sounds , and to those who have control of spirits , and to those
who are wise in secret arts .
And I will give the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord; and a hard king will be their ruler, says the Lord, the Lord of armies.
And the waters of the sea will be cut off, and the river will become dry and waste:
And the rivers will have an evil smell; the stream of Egypt will become small and dry: all the water-plants will come to nothing.
The grass-lands by the Nile, and everything planted by the Nile, will become dry, or taken away by the wind, and will come to an end.
The fishermen will be sad, and all those who put fishing-lines into the Nile will be full of grief, and those whose nets are stretched out on the waters will have sorrow in their hearts.
And all the workers in linen thread, and those who make cotton cloth, will be put to shame.
And the makers of twisted thread will be crushed, and those who ... will be sad in heart.
The chiefs of Zoan are completely foolish; the wisest guides of Pharaoh have become like beasts: how do you say to Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the offspring of early kings?
Where, then, are your wise men? let them make clear to you, let them give you knowledge of the purpose of the Lord of armies for Egypt.
The chiefs of Zoan have become foolish, the chiefs of Noph are tricked, the heads of her tribes are the cause of Egypt's wandering out of the way.
The Lord has sent among them a spirit of error: and by them Egypt is turned out of the right way in all her doings, as a man overcome by wine is uncertain in his steps.
And in Egypt there will be no work for any man, head or tail, high or low, to do.
In that day the Egyptians will be like women: and the land will be shaking with fear because of the waving of the Lord's hand stretched out over it.
And the land of Judah will become a cause of great fear to Egypt; whenever its name comes to mind, Egypt will be in fear before the Lord of armies because of his purpose against it.
In that day there will be five towns in the land of Egypt using the language of Canaan, and making oaths to the Lord of armies; and one of them will be named, The Town of the Sun.
In that day there will be an altar to the Lord in the middle of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the Lord at the edge of the land.
And it will be a sign and a witness to the Lord of armies in the land of Egypt: when they are crying out to the Lord because of their cruel masters, then he will send them a saviour and a strong one to make them free.
And the Lord will give the knowledge of himself to Egypt, and the Egyptians will give honour to the Lord in that day; they will give him worship with offerings and meal offerings, and will take an oath to the Lord and give effect to it.
And the Lord will send punishment on Egypt, and will make them well again; and when they come back to the Lord he will give ear to their prayer and take away their disease.
In that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and Assyria will come into Egypt, and Egypt will come into Assyria; and the Egyptians will give worship to the Lord together with the Assyrians.
In that day Israel will be the third together with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the earth:
Because of the blessing of the Lord of armies which he has given them, saying, A blessing on Egypt my people, and on Assyria the work of my hands, and on Israel my heritage.
The word which Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw about Judah and Jerusalem.
And it will come about in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord will be placed on the top of the mountains, and be lifted up over the hills; and all nations will come to it.
And the peoples will say , Come , and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord , to the house of the God of Jacob : and he will give us knowledge of his ways , and we will be guided by his word ; for out
of Zion the law will go out , and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem .
And he will be the judge between the nations , and the peoples will be ruled by his decisions : and their swords will be turned into plough-blades , and their spears into vine-knives : no longer will the nations be turning their swords against one another , and the
knowledge of war will be gone for ever .
O family of Jacob, come, and let us go in the light of the Lord.
For you, O Lord, have given up your people, the family of Jacob, because they are full of the evil ways of the east, and make use of secret arts like the Philistines, and are friends with the children of strange countries.
And their land is full of silver and gold, and there is no end to their stores; their land is full of horses, and there is no end to their carriages.
Their land is full of images; they give worship to the work of their hands, even to that which their fingers have made.
And the poor man's head is bent, and the great man goes down on his face: for this cause there will be no forgiveness for their sin.
Go into a hole in the rock, covering yourselves with dust, in fear of the Lord, before the glory of his power.
The high looks of man will be put to shame, and the pride of men will be made low, and only the Lord will be lifted up in that day.
For the day of the Lord of armies is coming on all the pride of men, and on all who are high and lifted up;
And on all the high trees of Lebanon, and on all the strong trees of Bashan;
And on all the high mountains, and on all the hills which are lifted up;
And on every high tower, and on every strong wall;
And on all the ships of Tarshish, and on all the fair boats.
And the high looks of man will be put to shame, and the pride of men will be made low: and only the Lord will be lifted up in that day.
And the images will never be seen again.
And men will go into cracks of the rocks, and into holes of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and before the glory of his power, when he comes out of his place, shaking the earth with his strength.
In that day men will put their images of silver and of gold, which they made for worship, in the keeping of the beasts of the dark places;
To take cover in the cracks of the rocks, and in the holes of the hills, for fear of the Lord, and before the glory of his power, when he comes out of his place, shaking the earth with his strength.
Have no more to do with man, whose life is only a breath, for he is of no value.
In the year when the Tartan came to Ashdod, sent by Sargon, king of Assyria, and made war against it and took it;
At that time the word of the Lord came to Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saying, Go, and take off your robe, and your shoes from your feet; and he did so, walking unclothed and without shoes on his feet.
And the Lord said, As my servant Isaiah has gone unclothed and without shoes for three years as a sign and a wonder to Egypt and Ethiopia,
So will the king of Assyria take away the prisoners of Egypt and those forced out of Ethiopia, young and old, unclothed and without shoes, and with backs uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
And they will be full of fear, and will no longer have faith in Ethiopia which was their hope, or in Egypt which was their glory.
And those living by the sea will say in that day, See the fate of our hope to whom we went for help and salvation from the king of Assyria: what hope have we then of salvation?
The word about the waste land. As storm-winds in the South go rushing through, it comes from the waste land, from the land greatly to be feared.
A vision of fear comes before my eyes; the worker of deceit goes on in his false way, and the waster goes on making waste. Up! Elam; to the attack! Media; I have put an end to her sorrow.
For this cause I am full of bitter grief; pains like the pains of a woman in childbirth have come on me: I am bent down with sorrow at what comes to my ears; I am shocked by what I see.
My mind is wandering, fear has overcome me: the evening of my desire has been turned into shaking for me.
They make ready the table, they put down the covers, they take food and drink. Up! you captains; put oil on your breastplates.
For so has the Lord said to me, Go, let a watchman be placed; let him give word of what he sees:
And when he sees war-carriages, horsemen by twos, war-carriages with asses, war-carriages with camels, let him give special attention.
And the watchman gave a loud cry, O my lord, I am on the watchtower all day, and am placed in my watch every night:
See, here come war-carriages with men, horsemen by twos: and in answer he said, Babylon is made low, is made low, and all her images are broken on the earth.
O my crushed ones, the grain of my floor! I have given you the word which came to me from the Lord of armies, the God of Israel.
The word about Edom. A voice comes to me from Seir, Watchman, how far gone is the night? how far gone is the night?
The watchman says, The morning has come, but night is still to come: if you have questions to put, put them, and come back again.
The word about Arabia. In the thick woods of Arabia will be your night's resting-place, O travelling bands of Dedanites!
Give water to him who is in need of water; give bread, O men of the land of Tema, to those in flight.
For they are in flight from the sharp sword, and the bent bow, and from the trouble of war.
For so has the Lord said to me, In a year, by the years of a servant working for payment, all the glory of Kedar will come to an end:
And the rest of the bowmen, the men of war of the children of Kedar, will be small in number: for the Lord, the God of Israel, has said it.
The word about the valley of vision. Why have all your people gone up to the house-tops?
You, who are full of loud voices, a town of outcries, given up to joy; your dead men have not been put to the sword, or come to their death in war.
All your rulers ... have gone in flight; all your strong ones have gone far away.
For this cause I have said, Let your eyes be turned away from me in my bitter weeping; I will not be comforted for the wasting of the daughter of my people.
For it is a day of trouble and of crushing down and of destruction from the Lord, the Lord of armies, in the valley of vision; ...
And Elam was armed with arrows, and Aram came on horseback; and the breastplate of Kir was uncovered.
And your most fertile valleys were full of war-carriages, and the horsemen took up their positions in front of the town.
He took away the cover of Judah; and in that day you were looking with care at the store of arms in the house of the woods.
And you saw all the broken places in the wall of the town of David: and you got together the waters of the lower pool.
And you had the houses of Jerusalem numbered, pulling down the houses to make the wall stronger.
And you made a place between the two walls for storing the waters of the old pool: but you gave no thought to him who had done this, and were not looking to him by whom it had been purposed long before.
And in that day the Lord, the Lord of armies, was looking for weeping, and cries of sorrow, cutting off of the hair, and putting on the clothing of grief:
But in place of these there was joy and delight, oxen and sheep were being made ready for food, there was feasting and drinking: men said, Now is the time for food and wine, for tomorrow death comes.
And the Lord of armies said to me secretly, Truly, this sin will not be taken from you till your death, says the Lord, the Lord of armies.
The Lord, the Lord of armies, says, Go to this person in authority, this Shebna, who is over the house; who has made himself a resting-place on high, cutting out a place for himself in the rock, and say,
Who are you, and by what right have you made for yourself a resting-place here?
See, O strong man, the Lord will send you violently away, gripping you with force,
Twisting you round and round like a ball he will send you out into a wide country: there you will come to your end, and there will be the carriages of your pride, O shame of your lord's house!
And I will have you forced out of your place of authority, and pulled down from your position.
And in that day I will send for my servant, Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah:
And I will put your robe on him, and put your band about him, and I will give your authority into his hand: and he will be a father to the men of Jerusalem, and to the family of Judah.
And I will give the key of the family of David into his care; and what he keeps open will be shut by no one, and what he keeps shut no one will make open.
And I will put him like a nail in a safe place; and he will be for a seat of glory to his father's family.
And all the glory of his father's family will be hanging on him, all their offspring, every small vessel, even the cups and the basins.
In that day, says the Lord of armies, will the nail fixed in a safe place give way; and it will be cut down, and in its fall the weight hanging on it will be cut off, for the Lord has said it.
The word about Tyre. Let a cry of sorrow go up, O ships of Tarshish, because your strong place is made waste; on the way back from the land of Kittim the news is given to them.
Send out a cry of grief, you men of the sea-land, traders of Zidon, who go over the sea, whose representatives are on great waters;
Who get in the seed of Shihor, whose wealth is the trade of the nations.
Be shamed, O Zidon: for the sea, the strong place of the sea has said, I have not been with child, or given birth; I have not taken care of young men, or kept watch over the growth of virgins.
When the news comes to Egypt they will be bitterly pained at the fate of Tyre.
Go over to Tarshish; give cries of sorrow, O men of the sea-land.
Is this the town which was full of joy, whose start goes back to times long past, whose wanderings took her into far-off countries?
By whom was this purposed against Tyre, the crowning town, whose traders are chiefs, whose business men are honoured in the land?
It was the purpose of the Lord of armies to put pride to shame, to make sport of the glory of those who are honoured in the earth.
Let your land be worked with the plough, O daughter of Tarshish; there is no longer any harbour.
His hand is stretched out over the sea, the kingdoms are shaking: the Lord has given orders about Canaan, to make waste its strong places.
And he said, There is no more joy for you, O crushed virgin daughter of Zidon: up! go over to Kittim; even there you will have no rest.
...
Let a cry of sorrow go up, O ships of Tarshish: because your strong place is made waste.
And it will be in that day that Tyre will go out of mind for seventy years, that is, the days of one king: after the end of seventy years it will be for Tyre as in the song of the loose woman.
Take an instrument of music, go about the town, O loose woman who has gone out from the memory of man; make sweet melody with songs, so that you may come back to men's minds.
And it will be after the end of seventy years, that the Lord will have mercy on Tyre, and she will go back to her trade, acting as a loose woman with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.
And her goods and her trade will be holy to the Lord: they will not be kept back or stored up; for her produce will be for those living in the Lord's land, to give them food for their needs, and fair clothing.
See, the Lord is making the earth waste and unpeopled, he is turning it upside down, and sending the people in all directions.
And it will be the same for the people as for the priest ; for the servant as for his master ; and for the woman-servant as for her owner ; the same for the one offering goods for a price as for him who takes them ; the same
for him who gives money at interest and for him who takes it ; the same for him who lets others have the use of his property as for those who make use of it .
The earth will be completely waste and without men; for this is the word of the Lord.
The earth is sorrowing and wasting away, the world is full of grief and wasting away, the high ones of the earth come to nothing.
The earth has been made unclean by those living in it; because the laws have not been kept by them, the orders have been changed, and the eternal agreement has been broken.
For this cause the earth is given up to the curse, and those in it are judged as sinners: for this cause those living on the earth are burned up, and the rest are small in number.
The new wine is thin, the vine is feeble, and all the glad-hearted make sounds of grief.
The pleasing sound of all instruments of music has come to an end, and the voices of those who are glad.
There is no more drinking of wine with a song; strong drink will be bitter to those who take it.
The town is waste and broken down: every house is shut up, so that no man may come in.
There is a crying in the streets because of the wine; there is an end of all delight, the joy of the land is gone.
In the town all is waste, and in the public place is destruction.
For it will be in the heart of the earth among the peoples, like the shaking of an olive-tree, as the last of the grapes after the getting-in is done.
But those will be making sounds of joy; they will be crying loudly from the sea for the glory of the Lord.
Give praise to the Lord in the east, to the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, in the sea-lands.
From the farthest part of the earth comes the sound of songs , glory to the upright . But I said , I am wasting away , wasting away , the curse is on me ! The false ones go on in their false way , yes , they go
on acting falsely .
Fear, and death, and the net, are come on you, O people of the earth.
And it will be that he who goes in flight from the sound of fear will be overtaken by death ; and he who gets free from death will be taken in the net : for the windows on high are open , and the bases of the earth are
shaking .
The earth is completely broken, it is parted in two, it is violently moved.
The earth will be moving uncertainly, like a man overcome by drink; it will be shaking like a tent; and the weight of its sin will be on it, crushing it down so that it will not get up again.
And in that day the Lord will send punishment on the army of the high ones on high, and on the kings of the earth on the earth.
And they will be got together, like prisoners in the prison-house; and after a long time they will have their punishment.
Then the moon will be veiled, and the sun put to shame; for the Lord of armies will be ruling in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before his judges he will let his glory be seen.
O Lord, you are my God; I will give praise to you, I will give honour to your name; for you have done great acts of power; your purposes in the past have been made true and certain in effect.
For you have made a town a waste place: a strong town a mass of broken walls; the tower of the men of pride has come to an end; it will never be put up again.
For this cause will the strong people give glory to you, the town of the cruel ones will be in fear of you.
For you have been a strong place for the poor and the crushed in their trouble, a safe place from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the wrath of the cruel ones is like a winter storm.
As heat by the shade of a cloud, the noise of the men of pride has been made quiet by you; as heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the cruel ones has been stopped.
And in this mountain will the Lord of armies make for all peoples a feast of good things, a feast of wines long stored, of good things sweet to the taste, of wines long kept and tested.
And in this mountain he will put an end to the shade covering the face of all peoples, and the veil which is stretched over all nations.
He has put an end to death for ever; and the Lord God will take away all weeping; and he will put an end to the shame of his people in all the earth: for the Lord has said it.
And in that day it will be said , See , this is our God ; we have been waiting for him , and he will be our saviour : this is the Lord in whom is our hope ; we will be glad and have delight in his salvation
For in this mountain will the hand of the Lord come to rest, and Moab will be crushed down in his place, even as the dry stems of the grain are crushed under foot in the waste place.
And if he puts out his hands, like a man stretching out his hands in swimming, the Lord will make low his pride, however expert his designs.
And the strong tower of your walls has been broken by him, made low, and crushed even to the dust.
In that day will this song be made in the land of Judah: We have a strong town; he will make salvation our walls and towers.
Let the doors be open, so that the upright nation which keeps faith may come in.
The man whose heart is unmoved you will keep in peace, because his hope is in you.
Let your hope be in the Lord for ever: for the Lord Jah is an unchanging Rock.
For he has made low those who are lifted up, all the people of the town of pride: he makes it low, crushing it down to the earth; he makes it low in the dust.
It will be crushed under the feet of the poor and the steps of those who are in need.
The way of the good man is straight; the road of the upright is made smooth by you.
We have been waiting for you, O Lord; the desire of our soul is for the memory of your name.
In the night the desire of my soul has been for you; early will my spirit be searching for you; for when your punishments come on the earth, the people of the world will get the knowledge of righteousness.
Even if you are kind to the evil-doer, he will not go after righteousness; even in the land of the upright he will still go on in his wrongdoing, and will not see the glory of the Lord.
Lord, your hand is lifted up, but they do not see: let them see ... yes, your haters will be burned up in the fire.
Lord, you will give us peace: for all our works are the outcome of your purpose.
O Lord, our God, other lords than you have had rule over us; but in you only is our salvation, and no other name will we take on our lips.
The dead will not come back to life: their spirits will not come back to earth; for this cause you have sent destruction on them, so that the memory of them is dead.
You have made the nation great, O Lord, you have made it great; glory is yours: you have made wide the limits of the land.
Lord, in trouble our eyes have been turned to you, we sent up a prayer when your punishment was on us.
As a woman with child, whose time is near, is troubled, crying out in her pain; so have we been before you, O Lord.
We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have given birth to wind; no salvation has come to the earth through us, and no children have come into the world.
Your dead will come back; their dead bodies will come to life again. Those in the dust, awaking from their sleep, will send out a song; for your dew is a dew of light, and the earth will give birth to the shades.
Come, my people, into your secret places, and let your doors be shut: keep yourself safe for a short time, till his wrath is over.
For the Lord is coming out of his place to send punishment on the people of the earth for their evil-doing: the earth will let the blood drained out on her be seen, and will keep her dead covered no longer.
In that day the Lord, with his great and strong and cruel sword, will send punishment on Leviathan, the quick-moving snake, and on Leviathan, the twisted snake; and he will put to death the dragon which is in the sea.
In that day it will be said, A vine-garden of delight, make a song about it.
I, the Lord, am watching it; I will give it water at all times: I will keep it night and day, for fear that any damage comes to it.
My passion is over: if the thorns were fighting against me, I would make an attack on them, and they would be burned up together.
Or let him put himself under my power, and make peace with me.
In days to come Jacob will take root: Israel will put out buds and flowers; and the face of the world will be full of fruit.
Is his punishment like the punishment of those who overcame him? or are his dead as great in number as those he put to the sword?
Your anger against her has been made clear by driving her away; he has taken her away with his storm-wind in the day of his east wind.
So by this will the sin of Jacob be covered, and this is all the fruit of taking away his punishment; when all the stones of the altar are crushed together, so that the wood pillars and the sun-images will not be put up again.
For the strong town is without men, an unpeopled living-place; and she has become a waste land: there the young ox will take his rest, and its branches will be food for him.
When its branches are dry they will be broken off ; the women will come and put fire to them : for it is a foolish people ; for this cause he who made them will have no mercy on them , and he whose work they are will not
have pity on them .
And it will be in that day that the Lord will get together his grain, from the River to the stream of Egypt, and you will be got together with care, O children of Israel.
And it will be in that day that a great horn will be sounded ; and those who were wandering in the land of Assyria , and those who had been sent away into the land of Egypt , will come ; and they will give worship to the Lord
in the holy mountain at Jerusalem .
Ho! crown of pride of those who are given up to wine in Ephraim, and the dead flower of his glory which is on the head of those who are overcome by strong drink!
See, the Lord has a strong and cruel one; like a rain of ice, a storm of destruction, like the overflowing of a strong river, he will violently overcome them.
The crown of pride of those who are given up to wine in Ephraim will be crushed under foot;
And the dead flower of his glory, which is on the head of the fertile valley, will be like the first early fruit before the summer; which a man takes and puts in his mouth the minute he sees it.
In that day will the Lord of armies be a crown of glory, and a fair ornament, to the rest of his people;
And a spirit of wisdom to the judge, and strength to those who keep back the attackers at the door of the town.
And further , these are uncertain through wine , and have gone out of the right way through strong drink : the priest and the prophet are uncertain through strong drink , they are overcome by wine , they have gone out of the way through strong drink ; their
vision is false , they go wrong in their decisions .
For all the tables are covered with coughed-up food, so that there is not a clean place.
To whom will he give knowledge? and to whom will he make clear the word? Will it be to those who have newly given up milk, and who have only now been taken from the breast?
For it is one rule after another; one line after another; here a little, there a little.
No, but with broken talk, and with a strange tongue, he will give his word to this people:
To whom he said, This is the rest, give rest to him who is tired; and by this you may get new strength; but they would not give ear.
For this cause the word of the Lord will be to them rule after rule, line after line, here a little, there a little; so that they may go on their way, and falling back may be broken, and taken in the net.
Give ear then to the word of the Lord, you men of pride, the rulers of this people in Jerusalem:
Because you have said , We have made death our friend , and with the underworld we have made an agreement ; when the overflowing waters come through they will not come near us ; for we are looking to false words for help , taking cover in what is
untrue :
For this cause says the Lord God, See, I am placing in Zion as a base, a stone, a tested stone, an angle-stone which is certain and of great value: and he who has faith will not give way.
And I will make right decision the measuring-line, and righteousness the weight: and the ice-storm will take away the safe place of false words, and the secret place will be covered by the flowing waters.
And the help you were looking for from death will come to nothing, and your agreement with the underworld will be broken; when the overflowing waters come through, then you will be overcome by them.
Whenever they come through they will overtake you; for they will come through morning after morning, by day and by night: and the news will be nothing but fear.
For the bed is not long enough for a man to be stretched out on: and the cover is not wide enough for him to be covered with.
For the Lord will come up as on Mount Perazim, he will be moved to wrath as in the valley of Gibeon; so that he may do his work--strange is his work; and give effect to his act--unnatural is his act.
And now , take care that you do not make sport of him , or your bands will be made strong ; for I have had word from the Lord , the Lord of armies , of an end , of a complete end , which is to come on
all the land .
Let your ears be open to my voice; give attention to what I say.
Is the ploughman for ever ploughing? does he not get the earth ready and broken up for the seed?
When the face of the earth has been levelled, does he not put in the different sorts of seed, and the grain in lines, and the barley in its place, and the spelt at the edge?
For his God is his teacher, giving him the knowledge of these things.
For the fitches are not crushed with a sharp instrument, and a cart-wheel is not rolled over the cummin; but the grain of the fitches is hammered out with a stick, and of the cummin with a rod.
Is the grain for bread crushed? He does not go on crushing it for ever, but he lets his cart-wheels and his horses go over it without crushing it.
This comes from the Lord of armies, purposing wonders, and wise in all his acts.
Ho! Ariel, Ariel, the town against which David made war; put year to year, let the feasts come round:
And I will send trouble on Ariel, and there will be weeping and cries of grief; and she will be to me as Ariel.
And I will make war on you like David, and you will be shut in by earthworks, and I will make towers round you.
And you will be made low , and your voice will come out of the earth , and your words will be low out of the dust ; and your voice will come out of the earth like that of a spirit , making bird-like noises out of the dust
And the army of your attackers will be like small dust, and all the cruel ones like dry stems gone before the wind; suddenly it will come about.
The Lord of armies will come in with thunder and earth-shaking and great noise, with rushing wind and storm, and the flame of burning fire.
And all the nations making war on Ariel, and all those who are fighting against her and shutting her in with their towers, will be like a dream, like a vision of the night.
And it will be like a man desiring food , and dreaming that he is feasting ; but when he is awake there is nothing in his mouth : or like a man in need of water , dreaming that he is drinking ; but when he is awake he
is feeble and his soul is full of desire : so will all the nations be which make war on Mount Zion .
Be surprised and full of wonder; let your eyes be covered and be blind: be overcome, but not with wine; go with uncertain steps, but not because of strong drink.
For the Lord has sent on you a spirit of deep sleep; and by him your eyes, the prophets, are shut, and your heads, the seers, are covered.
And the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a book which is shut , which men give to one who has knowledge of writing , saying , Make clear to us what is in the book : and he says , I am not
able to , for the book is shut :
And they give it to one without learning, saying, Make clear to us what is in the book: and he says, I have no knowledge of writing.
And the Lord said , because this people come near to me with their mouths , and give honour to me with their lips , but their heart is far from me , and their fear of me is false , a rule given them by the teaching of men
For this cause I will again do a strange thing among this people, a thing to be wondered at: and the wisdom of their wise men will come to nothing, and the sense of their guides will no longer be seen.
Cursed are those who go deep to keep their designs secret from the Lord, and whose works are in the dark, and who say, Who sees us? and who has knowledge of our acts?
You are turning things upside down ! Is the wet earth the same to you as the one who is forming it ? will the thing made say of him who made it , He made me not : or the thing formed say of him who gave it form
, He has no knowledge ?
In a very short time Lebanon will become a fertile field, and the fertile field will seem like a wood.
And in that day those whose ears are stopped will be hearing the words of the book; and the eyes of the blind will see through the mist and the dark.
And the poor will have their joy in the Lord increased, and those in need will be glad in the Holy One of Israel.
For the cruel one has come to nothing; and those who make sport of the Lord are gone; and those who are watching to do evil are cut off:
Who give help to a man in a wrong cause, and who put a net for the feet of him who gives decisions in the public place, taking away a man's right without cause.
For this reason the Lord, the saviour of Abraham, says about the family of Jacob, Jacob will not now be put to shame, or his face be clouded with fear.
But when they, the children of Jacob, see the work of my hands among them, they will give honour to my name; yes, they will give honour to the Holy One of Jacob, and go in fear of the God of Israel.
Those whose hearts were turned away from him will get knowledge, and those who made an outcry against him will give attention to his teaching.
For the Lord, the Lord of armies, is about to take away from Jerusalem and from Judah all their support; their store of bread and of water;
The strong man and the man of war; the judge and the prophet; the man who has knowledge of secret arts, and the man who is wise because of his years;
The captain of fifty, and the man of high position, and the wise guide, and the wonder-worker, and he who makes use of secret powers.
And I will make children their chiefs, and foolish ones will have rule over them.
And the people will be crushed, every one by his neighbour; the young will be full of pride against the old, and those of low position will be lifted up against the noble.
When one man puts his hand on another in his father's house, and says, You have clothing, be our ruler and be responsible for us in our sad condition:
Then he will say with an oath, I will not be a helper, for in my house there is no bread or clothing: I will not let you make me a ruler of the people.
For Jerusalem has become feeble, and destruction has come on Judah, because their words and their acts are against the Lord, moving the eyes of his glory to wrath.
Their respect for a man's position is a witness against them; and their sin is open to the view of all; like that of Sodom, it is not covered. A curse on their soul! for the measure of their sin is full.
Happy is the upright man! for he will have joy of the fruit of his ways.
Unhappy is the sinner! for the reward of his evil doings will come on him.
As for my people, their ruler is acting like a child, and those who have authority over them are women. O my people, your guides are the cause of your wandering, turning your footsteps out of the right way.
The Lord is ready to take up his cause against his people, and is about to come forward as their judge.
The Lord comes to be the judge of their responsible men and of their rulers: it is you who have made waste the vine-garden, and in your houses is the property of the poor which you have taken by force.
By what right are you crushing my people, and putting a bitter yoke on the necks of the poor? This is the word of the Lord, the Lord of armies.
Again, the Lord has said, Because the daughters of Zion are full of pride, and go with outstretched necks and wandering eyes, with their foot-chains sounding when they go:
The Lord will send disease on the heads of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will let their secret parts be seen.
In that day the Lord will take away the glory of their foot-rings, and their sun-jewels, and their moon-ornaments,
The ear-rings, and the chains, and the delicate clothing,
The head-bands, and the arm-chains, and the worked bands, and the perfume-boxes, and the jewels with secret powers,
The rings, and the nose-jewels,
The feast-day dresses, and the robes, and the wide skirts, and the handbags,
The looking-glasses, and the fair linen, and the high head-dresses, and the veils.
And in the place of sweet spices will be an evil smell , and for a fair band a thick cord ; for a well-dressed head there will be the cutting-off of the hair , and for a beautiful robe there will be the clothing of sorrow ; the mark
of the prisoner in place of the ornaments of the free .
Your men will be put to the sword, and your men of war will come to destruction in the fight.
And in the public places of her towns will be sorrow and weeping; and she will be seated on the earth, waste and uncovered.
Ho! uncontrolled children, says the Lord, who give effect to a purpose which is not mine, and who make an agreement, but not by my spirit, increasing their sin:
Who make a move to go down into Egypt, without authority from me; who are looking to the strength of Pharaoh for help, and whose hope is in the shade of Egypt.
And the strength of Pharaoh will be your shame, and your hope in the shade of Egypt will come to nothing.
For his chiefs are at Zoan, and his representatives have come to Hanes.
For they have all come with offerings to a people of no use to them, in whom is no help or profit, but only shame and a bad name.
The word about the Beasts of the South . Through the land of trouble and grief , the land of the she-lion and the voice of the lion , of the snake and the burning winged snake , they take their wealth on the backs of young asses , and
their stores on camels , to a people in whom is no profit .
For there is no use or purpose in the help of Egypt: so I have said about her, She is Rahab, who has come to an end.
Now go, put it in writing before them on a board, and make a record of it in a book, so that it may be for the future, a witness for all time to come.
For they are an uncontrolled people, false-hearted, who will not give ear to the teaching of the Lord:
Who say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Do not give us word of what is true, but say false things to give us pleasure:
Get out of the good way, turning from the right road; do not keep the Holy One of Israel before our minds.
For this cause the Holy One of Israel says, Because you will not give ear to this word, and are looking for help in ways of deceit and evil, and are putting your hope in them:
This sin will be to you like a crack in a high wall, causing its fall suddenly and in a minute.
And he will let it be broken as a potter's vessel is broken: it will be smashed to bits without mercy; so that there will not be a bit in which one may take fire from the fireplace, or water from the spring.
For the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, said, In quiet and rest is your salvation: peace and hope are your strength: but you would not have it so.
Saying, No, for we will go in flight on horses; so you will certainly go in flight: and, We will go on the backs of quick-running beasts; so those who go after you will be quick-footed.
A thousand will go in fear before one; even before five you will go in flight: till you are like a pillar by itself on the top of a mountain, and like a flag on a hill.
For this cause the Lord will be waiting , so that he may be kind to you ; and he will be lifted up , so that he may have mercy on you ; for the Lord is a God of righteousness : there is a blessing on all whose
hope is in him .
O people, living in Zion, at Jerusalem, your weeping will be ended; he will certainly have mercy on you at the sound of your cry; when it comes to his ear, he will give you an answer.
And though the Lord will give you the bread of trouble and the water of grief, you will no longer put your teacher on one side, but you will see your teacher:
And at your back, when you are turning to the right hand or to the left, a voice will be sounding in your ears, saying, This is the way in which you are to go.
And you will make unclean what is covering your pictured images of silver, and the plating of your images of gold: you will send them away as an unclean thing, saying, Be gone!
And he will give rain for your seed , so that you may put it in the earth ; and you will have bread from the produce of the earth , good and more than enough for your needs : in that day the cattle will get their food in
wide grass-lands .
And the oxen and the young asses which are used for ploughing, will have salted grain which has been made free from the waste with fork and basket.
And there will be rivers and streams of water on every tall mountain and on every high hill, in the day when great numbers are put to the sword, when the towers come down.
And the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun , and the light of the sun will be seven times greater , as the light of seven days , in the day when the Lord puts oil on the wounds of his people , and
makes them well from the blows they have undergone .
See, the name of the Lord is coming from far, burning with his wrath, with thick smoke going up: his lips are full of passion, and his tongue is like a burning fire:
And his breath is as an overflowing stream , coming up even to the neck , shaking the nations for their destruction , like the shaking of grain in a basket : and he will put a cord in the mouths of the people , turning them out of their
way .
You will have a song, as in the night when a holy feast is kept; and you will be glad in heart, as when they go with music of the pipe to the mountain of the Lord, the Rock of Israel.
And the Lord will send out the sound of his great voice, and they will see his arm stretched out, with the heat of his wrath, and the flame of a burning fire; with a cloud-burst, and storm, and a rain of ice.
For through the voice of the Lord the Assyrian will be broken, and the Lord's rod will be lifted up against him.
And every blow of the rod of his punishment, which the Lord will send on him, will be with the sound of music: and with the waving of his sword the Lord will make war against him.
For a place of fire has long been ready ; yes , it has been made ready for the king ; he has made it deep and wide : it is massed with fire and much wood ; the breath of the Lord , like a stream of fire ,
puts a light to it .
Cursed are those who go down to Egypt for help , and who put their faith in horses ; looking to war-carriages for salvation , because of their numbers ; and to horsemen , because they are very strong ; but they are not looking to the Holy One of
Israel , or turning their hearts to the Lord ;
Though he is wise, and able to send evil, and his purpose will not be changed; but he will go against the house of the evil-doers, and against those to whom they are looking for help.
For the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses are flesh, and not spirit: and when the Lord's hand is stretched out, the helper and he who is helped will come down together.
For the Lord has said to me , As a lion , or a young lion , makes an angry noise over his food , and if a band of herdsmen come out against him , he will not be in fear of their voices , or give up his
food for their noise : so the Lord of armies will come down to make war against Mount Zion and its hill .
Like birds with outstretched wings, so will the Lord of armies be a cover to Jerusalem; he will be a cover and salvation for it, going over it he will keep it from danger.
Come back to him who has been so deeply sinned against by the children of Israel.
For in that day they will all give up their images of silver and of gold, the sin which they made for themselves.
Then the Assyrian will come down by the sword , but not of man ; the sword , not of men , will be the cause of his destruction : and he will go in flight from the sword , and his young men will be put to forced work
And his rock will come to nothing because of fear, and his chiefs will go in flight from the flag, says the Lord, whose fire is in Zion, and his altar in Jerusalem.
See, a king will be ruling in righteousness, and chiefs will give right decisions.
And a man will be as a safe place from the wind, and a cover from the storm; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shade of a great rock in a waste land.
And the eyes of those who see will not be shut, and those who have hearing will give ear to the word.
The man of sudden impulses will become wise in heart, and he whose tongue is slow will get the power of talking clearly.
The foolish man will no longer be named noble, and they will not say of the false man that he is a man of honour.
For the foolish man will say foolish things, having evil thoughts in his heart, working what is unclean, and talking falsely about the Lord, to keep food from him who is in need of it, and water from him whose soul is desiring it.
The designs of the false are evil, purposing the destruction of the poor man by false words, even when he is in the right.
But the noble-hearted man has noble purposes, and by these he will be guided.
Give ear to my voice, you women who are living in comfort; give attention to my words, you daughters who have no fear of danger.
In not much more than a year, you, who are not looking for evil, will be troubled: for the produce of the vine-gardens will be cut off, and there will be no getting in of the grapes.
Be shaking with fear, you women who are living in comfort; be troubled, you who have no fear of danger: take off your robes and put on clothing of grief.
Have sorrow for the fields, the pleasing fields, the fertile vine;
And for the land of my people, where thorns will come up; even for all the houses of joy in the glad town.
For the fair houses will have no man living in them ; the town which was full of noise will become a waste ; the hill and the watchtower will be unpeopled for ever , a joy for the asses of the woods , a place of food for the
flocks ;
Till the spirit comes on us from on high, and the waste land becomes a fertile field, and the fertile field is changed into a wood.
Then in the waste land there will be an upright rule, and righteousness will have its place in the fertile field.
And the work of righteousness will be peace; and the effect of an upright rule will be to take away fear for ever.
And my people will be living in peace, in houses where there is no fear, and in quiet resting-places.
But the tall trees will come down with a great fall, and the town will be low in a low place.
Happy are you who are planting seed by all the waters, and sending out the ox and the ass.
Ho ! you who make waste those who did not make you waste ; acting falsely to those who were not false to you . When you have come to an end of wasting , you will be made waste , and after your false acts , they will do
the same to you .
O Lord, have mercy on us; for we have been waiting for your help: be our strength every morning, our salvation in time of trouble.
At the loud noise the peoples have gone in flight; at your coming up the nations have gone in all directions.
And the goods taken in war will be got together like the massing of young locusts; men will be rushing on them like the rushing of locusts.
The Lord is lifted up; his place is on high: he has made Zion full of righteousness and true religion.
And she will have no more fear of change, being full of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge: the fear of the Lord is her wealth.
See, the men of war are sorrowing outside the town: those who came looking for peace are weeping bitterly.
The highways are waste, no man is journeying there: the agreement is broken, he has made sport of the towns, he has no thought for man.
The earth is sorrowing and wasting away; Lebanon is put to shame and has become waste; Sharon is like the Arabah; and in Bashan and Carmel the leaves are falling.
Now will I come forward, says the Lord; now will I be lifted up; now will my power be seen.
Your designs will be without profit, and their effect will be nothing: you will be burned up by the fire of my breath.
And the peoples will be like the burning of chalk: as thorns cut down, which are burned in the fire.
Give ear, you who are far off, to what I have done: see my power, you who are near.
The sinners in Zion are full of fear; the haters of God are shaking with wonder. Who among us may keep his place before the burning fire? who among us may see the eternal burnings?
He whose ways are true, and whose words are upright; he who gives no thought to the profits of false acts, whose hands have not taken rewards, who will have no part in putting men to death, and whose eyes are shut against evil;
He will have a place on high: he will be safely shut in by the high rocks: his bread will be given to him; his waters will be certain.
Your eyes will see the king in his glory: they will be looking on a far-stretching land.
Your heart will give thought to the cause of your fear: where is the scribe, where is he who made a record of the payments, where is he by whom the towers were numbered?
Never again will you see the cruel people, a people whose tongue has no sense for you; whose language is strange to you.
Let your eyes be resting on Zion, the town of our holy feasts: you will see Jerusalem, a quiet resting-place, a tent which will not be moved, whose tent-pins will never be pulled up, and whose cords will never be broken.
But there the Lord will be with us in his glory, ... wide rivers and streams; where no boat will go with blades, and no fair ship will be sailing.
For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our law-giver, the Lord is our king; he will be our saviour.
Your cords have become loose; they were not able to make strong the support of their sails, the sail was not stretched out: then the blind will take much property, the feeble-footed will make division of the goods of war.
And the men of Zion will not say, I am ill: for its people will have forgiveness for their sin.
Come near, you nations, and give ear; take note, you peoples: let the earth and everything in it give ear; the world and all those living in it.
For the Lord is angry with all the nations, and his wrath is burning against all their armies: he has put them to the curse, he has given them to destruction.
Their dead bodies will be thick on the face of the earth, and their smell will come up, and the mountains will be flowing with their blood, and all the hills will come to nothing.
And the heavens will be rolled together like the roll of a book: and all their army will be gone, like a dead leaf from the vine, or a dry fruit from the fig-tree.
For my sword in heaven is full of wrath: see, it is coming down on Edom, in punishment on the people of my curse.
The sword of the Lord is full of blood , it is fat with the best of the meat , with the blood of lambs and goats , with the best parts of the sheep : for the Lord has a feast in Bozrah , and much cattle will be
put to death in the land of Edom .
And the strong oxen will go down to death together with the smaller cattle.
For it is the day of the Lord's punishment, when he gives payment for the wrongs done to Zion.
And its streams will be turned into boiling oil, and its dust into burning stone, and all the land will be on fire.
It will not be put out day or night; its smoke will go up for ever: it will be waste from generation to generation; no one will go through it for ever.
But the birds of the waste land will have their place there; it will be a heritage for the bittern and the raven: and it will be measured out with line and weight as a waste land.
The jackals will be there, and her great ones will be gone; they will say, There is no longer a kingdom there, and all her chiefs will have come to an end.
And thorns will come up in her fair houses, and waste plants in her strong towers: and foxes will make their holes there, and it will be a meeting-place for ostriches.
And the beasts of the waste places will come together with the jackals, and the evil spirits will be crying to one another, even the night-spirit will come and make her resting-place there.
The arrowsnake will make her hole and put her eggs there, and get her young together under her shade: there the hawks will come together by twos.
See what is recorded in the book of the Lord: all these will be there, not one without the other: the mouth of the Lord has given the order, and his spirit has made them come together.
And he has given them their heritage, and by his hand it has been measured out to them: it will be theirs for ever, their resting-place from generation to generation.
The waste land and the dry places will be glad; the lowland will have joy and be full of flowers.
It will be flowering like the rose; it will be full of delight and songs; the glory of Lebanon will be given to it; the pride of Carmel and Sharon: they will see the glory of the Lord, the power of our God.
Make strong the feeble hands, give support to the shaking knees.
Say to those who are full of fear, Be strong and take heart: see, your God will give punishment; the reward of God will come; he himself will come to be your saviour.
Then the eyes of the blind will see, and the ears which are stopped will be open.
Then will the feeble-footed be jumping like a roe, and the voice which was stopped will be loud in song: for in the waste land streams will be bursting out, and waters in the dry places.
And the burning sand will become a pool, and the dry earth springs of waters: the fields where the sheep take their food will become wet land, and water-plants will take the place of grass.
And a highway will be there; its name will be, The Holy Way; the unclean and the sinner may not go over it, and those who go on it will not be turned out of the way by the foolish.
No lion will be there, or any cruel beast; they will not be seen there; but those for whom the Lord has given a price,
Even those whom he has made free, will come back again; they will come with songs to Zion; on their heads will be eternal joy; delight and joy will be theirs, and sorrow and sounds of grief will be gone for ever.
And it came about in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah that Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came up against all the walled towns of Judah and took them.
And the king of Assyria sent the Rab-shakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a strong force, and he took up his position by the stream of the higher pool, by the highway of the washerman's
And there came out to him Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder.
And the Rab-shakeh said to them, Say now to Hezekiah, These are the words of the great king, the king of Assyria: In what are you placing your hope?
You say you have a design and strength for war, but these are only words: now to whom are you looking for support, that you have gone against my authority?
See , you are basing your hope on that broken rod of Egypt , which will go into a man ' s hand if he makes use of it for a support ; for so is Pharaoh , king of Egypt , to all who put their faith in him
And if you say to me, Our hope is in the Lord our God; is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away, saying to Judah and Jerusalem that worship may only be given before this altar?
And now, take a chance with my master, the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able to put horsemen on them.
How then may you put to shame the least of my master's servants? and you have put your hope in Egypt for war-carriages and horsemen:
And have I now come to send destruction on this land without the Lord's authority? It was the Lord himself who said to me, Go up against this land and make it waste.
Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to the Rab-shakeh , Please make use of the Aramaean language in talking to your servants , for we are used to it , and do not make use of the Jews ' language in the hearing of the people on the wall
But the Rab-shakeh said , Is it to your master or to you that my master has sent me to say these words ? has he not sent me to the men seated on the wall ? for they are the people who will be short of food with you
when the town is shut in .
Then the Rab-shakeh got up and said with a loud voice in the Jews' language, Give ear to the words of the great king, the king of Assyria:
This is what the king says: Do not be tricked by Hezekiah, for there is no salvation for you in him.
And do not let Hezekiah make you put your faith in the Lord, saying, The Lord will certainly keep us safe, and this town will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria.
Do not give ear to Hezekiah , for this is what the king of Assyria says , Make peace with me , and come out to me ; and everyone will be free to take the fruit of his vine and of his fig-tree , and the water of his
spring ;
Till I come and take you away to a land like yours, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vine-gardens.
Give no attention to Hezekiah when he says to you, The Lord will keep us safe. Has any one of the gods of the nations kept his land from falling into the hands of the king of Assyria?
Where are the gods of Hamath and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? where are the gods of Samaria? and have they kept Samaria out of my hand?
Who among all the gods of these countries have kept their country from falling into my hand, to give cause for the thought that the Lord will keep Jerusalem from falling into my hand?
But they kept quiet and gave him no answer: for the king's order was, Give him no answer.
Then Eliakim , the son of Hilkiah , who was over the house , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah , the son of Asaph , the recorder , came to Hezekiah with their clothing parted as a sign of grief , and gave him an account of what
the Rab-shakeh had said .
And on hearing it Hezekiah took off his robe and put on haircloth and went into the house of the Lord.
And he sent Eliakim, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the chief priests, dressed in haircloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.
And they said to him, Hezekiah says, This day is a day of trouble and punishment and shame: for the children are ready to come to birth, but there is no strength to give birth to them.
It may be that the Lord your God will give ear to the words of the Rab-shakeh , whom the king of Assyria , his master , has sent to say evil things against the living God , and will make his words come to nothing : so make your
prayer for the rest of the people .
So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
And Isaiah said to them, This is what you are to say to your master: The Lord says, Be not troubled by the words which the servants of the king of Assyria have said against me in your hearing.
See, I will put a spirit into him, and bad news will come to his ears, and he will go back to his land; and there I will have him put to death.
So the Rab-shakeh went back, and when he got there the king of Assyria was making war against Libnah: for it had come to his ears that the king of Assyria had gone away from Lachish.
And when news came to him that Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia, had made an attack on him, ... And he sent representatives to Hezekiah, king of Judah, saying,
This is what you are to say to Hezekiah, king of Judah: Let not your God, in whom is your faith, give you a false hope, saying, Jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria.
No doubt the story has come to your ears of what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, putting them to the curse: and will you be kept safe from their fate?
Did the gods of the nations keep safe those on whom my fathers sent destruction, Gozan and Haran and Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?
Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the town of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivva?
And Hezekiah took the letter from the hands of those who had come with it; and after reading it, Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord, opening the letter there before the Lord,
And he made prayer to the Lord, saying,
O Lord of armies, the God of Israel, seated between the winged ones, you only are the God of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.
Let your ear be turned to us, O Lord; let your eyes be open, O Lord, and see: take note of all the words of Sennacherib who has sent men to say evil against the living God.
Truly, O Lord, the kings of Assyria have made waste all the nations and their lands,
And have given their gods to the fire: for they were no gods, but wood and stone, the work of men's hands; so they have given them to destruction.
But now, O Lord our God, give us salvation from his hand, so that it may be clear to all the kingdoms of the earth that you, and you only, are the Lord.
Then Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent to Hezekiah, saying, The Lord, the God of Israel, says, The prayer you have made to me against Sennacherib, king of Assyria, has come to my ears.
This is the word which the Lord has said about him: In the eyes of the virgin daughter of Zion you are shamed and laughed at; the daughter of Jerusalem has made sport of you.
Against whom have you said evil and bitter things? and against whom has your voice been loud and your eyes lifted up? even against the Holy One of Israel.
You have sent your servants with evil words against the Lord , and have said , With all my war-carriages I have come up to the top of the mountains , to the inmost parts of Lebanon ; and its tall cedars will be cut down , and the best
trees of its woods : I will come up into his highest places , into his thick woods .
I have made water-holes and taken their waters, and with my foot I have made all the rivers of Egypt dry.
Has it not come to your ears how I did it long before, purposing it in times long past? Now I have given effect to my design, so that by you strong towns might be turned into masses of broken walls.
This is why their townsmen had no power, they were broken and put to shame; they were like the grass of the field, or a green plant; like the grass on the house-tops, which a cold wind makes waste.
But I have knowledge of your getting up and your resting, of your going out and your coming in.
Because your wrath against me and your pride have come to my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my cord in your lips, and I will make you go back by the way you came.
And this will be the sign to you : you will get your food this year from what comes up of itself , and in the second year from the produce of the same ; and in the third year you will put in your seed , and get in
the grain , and make vine-gardens , and take of their fruit .
And those of Judah who are still living will again take root in the earth, and give fruit.
For from Jerusalem those who have been kept safe will go out, and those who are still living will go out of Mount Zion: by the fixed purpose of the Lord of armies this will be done.
For this cause the Lord says about the king of Assyria, He will not come into this town, or send an arrow against it; he will not come before it with arms, or put up an earthwork against it.
By the way he came he will go back, and he will not get into this town.
For I will keep this town safe, for my honour, and for the honour of my servant David.
And the angel of the Lord went out and put to death in the army of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand men: and when the people got up early in the morning, there was nothing to be seen but dead bodies.
Sennacherib, king of Assyria, went back to his place at Nineveh.
And it came about , when he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god , that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer put him to death with the sword , and they went in flight into the land of Ararat . And Esar-haddon , his son , became king
in his place .
In those days Hezekiah was ill and near death. And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him, and said to him, The Lord says, Put your house in order; for your death is near.
And Hezekiah, turning his face to the wall, made his prayer to the Lord, saying,
O Lord, keep in mind how I have been true to you with all my heart, and have done what is good in your eyes. And Hezekiah gave way to bitter weeping.
Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah, saying,
Go to Hezekiah, and say, The Lord, the God of David, your father, says, Your prayer has come to my ears, and I have seen your weeping: see, I will give you fifteen more years of life.
And I will keep you and this town safe from the hands of the king of Assyria: and I will keep watch over this town.
And Isaiah said, This is the sign the Lord will give you, that he will do what he has said:
See, I will make the shade which has gone down on the steps of Ahaz with the sun, go back ten steps. So the shade went back the ten steps by which it had gone down.
The writing of Hezekiah, king of Judah, after he had been ill, and had got better from his disease.
I said, In the quiet of my days I am going down into the underworld: the rest of my years are being taken away from me.
I said, I will not see the Lord, even the Lord in the land of the living: I will not see man again or those living in the world.
My resting-place is pulled up and taken away from me like a herdsman ' s tent : my life is rolled up like a linen-worker ' s thread ; I am cut off from the cloth on the frame : from day even to night you give me up to
pain .
I am crying out with pain till the morning; it is as if a lion was crushing all my bones.
I make cries like a bird; I give out sounds of grief like a dove: my eyes are looking up with desire; O Lord, I am crushed, take up my cause.
What am I to say? seeing that it is he who has done it: all my time of sleeping I am turning from side to side without rest.
O Lord, for this cause I am waiting for you, give rest to my spirit: make me well again, and let me come back to life.
See, in place of peace my soul had bitter sorrow. but you have kept back my soul from the underworld; for you have put all my sins out of your memory.
For the underworld is not able to give you praise, death gives you no honour: for those who go down into the underworld there is no hope in your mercy.
The living, the living man, he will give you praise, as I do this day: the father will give the story of your mercy to his children.
O Lord, quickly be my saviour; so we will make my songs to corded instruments all the days of our lives in the house of the Lord.
And Isaiah said, Let them take a cake of figs, and put it on the diseased place, and he will get well.
And Hezekiah said, What is the sign that I will go up to the house of the Lord?
At that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters with an offering to Hezekiah, because he had news that Hezekiah had been ill, and was well again.
And Hezekiah was glad at their coming , and let them see all his store of wealth , the silver and the gold and the spices and the oil , and all the house of his arms , and everything there was in his stores : there was nothing in
all his house or his kingdom which he did not let them see .
Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, What did these men say, and where did they come from? And Hezekiah said, They came from a far country, even from Babylon.
And he said, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah said in answer, They saw everything in my house: there is nothing among my stores which I did not let them see.
Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Give ear to the word of the Lord of armies:
Truly, the days are coming when everything in your house, and whatever your fathers have put in store till this day, will be taken away to Babylon: all will be gone.
And your sons, even your offspring, will they take away to be unsexed servants in the house of the king of Babylon.
Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the Lord which you have said. And he said in his heart, There will be peace and quiet in my days.
And in that day seven women will put their hands on one man, saying, There will be no need for you to give us food or clothing, only let us go under your name, so that our shame may be taken away.
In that day will the young growth of the Lord be beautiful in glory, and the fruit of the earth will be the pride of those who are still living in Israel.
And it will come about that the rest of the living in Zion, and of those who have been kept from destruction in Jerusalem, will be named holy, even everyone who has been recorded for life in Jerusalem:
When Zion has been washed from her sin by the Lord, and Jerusalem made clean from her blood by a judging and a burning wind.
And over every living-place on Mount Zion , all over all her meetings , the Lord will make a cloud and smoke by day , and the shining of a flaming fire by night , for over all , the glory of the Lord will be a cover and a
tent ;
And a shade in the daytime from the heat, and a safe cover from storm and from rain.
Give comfort, give comfort, to my people, says your God.
Say kind words to the heart of Jerusalem, crying out to her that her time of trouble is ended, that her punishment is complete; that she has been rewarded by the Lord's hand twice over for all her sins.
A voice of one crying, Make ready in the waste land the way of the Lord, make level in the lowland a highway for our God.
Let every valley be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low, and let the rough places become level, and the hilltops become a valley,
And the glory of the Lord will be made clear, and all flesh will see it together, for the mouth of the Lord has said it.
A voice of one saying, Give a cry! And I said, What is my cry to be? All flesh is grass, and all its strength like the flower of the field.
The grass becomes dry, the flower is dead; because the breath of the Lord goes over it: truly the people is grass.
The grass is dry, the flower is dead; but the word of our God is eternal.
You who give good news to Zion, get up into the high mountain; you who give good news to Jerusalem, let your voice be strong; let it be sounding without fear; say to the towns of Judah, See, your God!
See, the Lord God will come as a strong one, ruling in power: see, those made free by him are with him, and those whom he has made safe go before him.
He will give food to his flock like a keeper of sheep; with his arm he will get it together, and will take up the lambs on his breast, gently guiding those which are with young.
In the hollow of whose hand have the waters been measured ? and who is able to take the heavens in his stretched-out fingers ? who has got together the dust of the earth in a measure ? who has taken the weight of the mountains , or put the
hills into the scales ?
By whom has the spirit of the Lord been guided, or who has been his teacher?
Who gave him suggestions, and made clear to him the right way? who gave him knowledge, guiding him in the way of wisdom?
See, the nations are to him like a drop hanging from a bucket, and like the small dust in the scales: he takes up the islands like small dust.
And Lebanon is not enough to make a fire with, or all its cattle enough for a burned offering.
All the nations are as nothing before him; even less than nothing, a thing of no value.
Whom then is God like, in your opinion? or what will you put forward as a comparison with him?
The workman makes an image, and the gold-worker puts gold plates over it, and makes silver bands for it.
The wise workman makes selection of the mulberry-tree of the offering, a wood which will not become soft; so that the image may be fixed to it and not be moved.
Have you no knowledge of it? has it not come to your ears? has not news of it been given to you from the first? has it not been clear to you from the time when the earth was placed on its base?
It is he who is seated over the arch of the earth, and the people in it are as small as locusts; by him the heavens are stretched out like an arch, and made ready like a tent for a living-place.
He makes rulers come to nothing; the judges of the earth are of no value.
They have only now been planted, and their seed put into the earth, and they have only now taken root, when he sends out his breath over them and they become dry, and the storm-wind takes them away like dry grass.
Who then seems to you to be my equal? says the Holy One.
Let your eyes be lifted up on high , and see : who has made these ? He who sends out their numbered army : who has knowledge of all their names : by whose great strength , because he is strong in power , all of them are in
their places .
Why do you say, O Jacob, such words as these, O Israel, The Lord's eyes are not on my way, and my God gives no attention to my cause?
Have you no knowledge of it? has it not come to your ears? The eternal God, the Lord, the Maker of the ends of the earth, is never feeble or tired; there is no searching out of his wisdom.
He gives power to the feeble, increasing the strength of him who has no force.
Even the young men will become feeble and tired, and the best of them will come to the end of his strength;
But those who are waiting for the Lord will have new strength; they will get wings like eagles: running, they will not be tired, and walking, they will have no weariness.
Come quietly before me, O sea-lands, and let the peoples get together their strength: let them come near; then let them say what they have to say: let us put forward our cause against one another.
Who sent out from the east one who is right wherever he goes? he gives the nations into his hands, and makes him ruler over kings; he gives them as the dust to his sword, as dry stems before the wind to his bow.
He goes after them safely, not touching the road with his feet.
Whose purpose and work was it? His who sent out the generations from the start. I the Lord, the first, and with the last, I am he.
The sea-lands saw it, and were in fear; the ends of the earth were shaking: they came near.
They gave help everyone to his neighbour; and everyone said to his brother, Take heart!
So the metal-worker put heart into the gold-worker, and he who was hammering the metal smooth said kind words to the iron-worker, saying of the plate, It is ready: and he put it together with nails, so that there might be no slipping.
But as for you, Israel, my servant, and you, Jacob, whom I have taken for myself, the seed of Abraham my friend:
You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and sent for from its farthest parts, saying to you, You are my servant, whom I have taken for myself, and whom I have not given up:
Have no fear, for I am with you; do not be looking about in trouble, for I am your God; I will give you strength, yes, I will be your helper; yes, my true right hand will be your support.
Truly, all those who are angry with you will be made low and put to shame: those desiring to do you wrong will come to nothing and never again be seen.
You will make search for your haters but they will not be there; those who make war against you will be as nothing and will come to destruction.
For I, the Lord your God, have taken your right hand in mine, saying to you, Have no fear; I will be your helper.
Have no fear, you worm Jacob, and you men of Israel; I will be your helper, says the Lord, even he who takes up your cause, the Holy One of Israel.
See, I will make you like a new grain-crushing instrument with teeth, crushing the mountains small, and making the hills like dry stems.
You will send the wind over them, and it will take them away; they will go in all directions before the storm-wind: you will have joy in the Lord, and be glad in the Holy One of Israel.
The poor and crushed are looking for water where no water is, and their tongue is dry for need of it: I the Lord will give ear to their prayer, I the God of Israel will not give them up.
I will make rivers on the dry mountain-tops, and fountains in the valleys: I will make the waste land a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.
I will put in the waste land the cedar, the acacia, the myrtle, and the olive-tree; and in the lowland will be planted the fir-tree, the plane, and the cypress together:
So that they may see and be wise and give their mind to it, and that it may be clear to them all that the hand of the Lord has done this, and that the Holy One of Israel has made it.
Put forward your cause, says the Lord; let your strong argument come out, says the King of Jacob.
Let the future be made clear to us: give us news of the past things, so that we may give thought to them; or of the things to come, so that we may see if they are true.
Give us word of what will be after this, so that we may be certain that you are gods: yes, do good or do evil, so that we may all see it and be surprised.
But you are nothing, and your work is of no value: foolish is he who takes you for his gods.
I have sent for one from the north , and from the dawn he has come ; in my name he will get rulers together and go against them ; they will be like dust , even as the wet earth is stamped on by the feet of the potter
Who has given knowledge of it from the first , so that we may be certain of it ? and from the start , so that we may say , His word is true ? There is no one who gives news , or says anything , or who gives
ear to your words .
I was the first to give word of it to Zion, and I gave the good news to Jerusalem.
And I saw that there was no man, even no wise man among them, who might give an answer to my questions.
Truly they are all nothing, their works are nothing and of no value: their metal images are of no more use than wind.
See my servant, whom I am supporting, my loved one, in whom I take delight: I have put my spirit on him; he will give the knowledge of the true God to the nations.
He will make no cry, his voice will not be loud: his words will not come to men's ears in the streets.
He will not let a crushed stem be quite broken, and he will not let a feebly burning light be put out: he will go on sending out the true word to the peoples.
His light will not be put out, and he will not be crushed, till he has given the knowledge of the true God to the earth, and the sea-lands will be waiting for his teaching.
God the Lord, even he who made the heavens, measuring them out on high; stretching out the earth, and giving its produce; he who gives breath to the people on it, and life to those who go about on it, says:
I the Lord have made you the vessel of my purpose, I have taken you by the hand, and kept you safe, and I have given you to be an agreement to the people, and a light to the nations:
To give eyes to the blind, to make free the prisoners from the prison, to let out those who are shut up in the dark.
I am the Lord; that is my name: I will not give my glory to another, or my praise to pictured images.
See, the things said before have come about, and now I give word of new things: before they come I give you news of them.
Make a new song to the Lord, and let his praise be sounded from the end of the earth; you who go down to the sea, and everything in it, the sea-lands and their people.
Let the waste land and its flocks be glad, the tent-circles of Kedar; let the people of the rock give a glad cry, from the top of the mountains let them make a sound of joy.
Let them give glory to the Lord, sounding his praise in the sea-lands.
The Lord will go out as a man of war, he will be moved to wrath like a fighting-man: his voice will be strong, he will give a loud cry; he will go against his attackers like a man of war.
I have long been quiet, I have kept myself in and done nothing: now I will make sounds of pain like a woman in childbirth, breathing hard and quickly.
I will make waste mountains and hills, drying up all their plants; and I will make rivers dry, and pools dry land.
And I will take the blind by a way of which they had no knowledge , guiding them by roads strange to them : I will make the dark places light before them , and the rough places level . These things will I do and will not give them
up .
They will be turned back and be greatly shamed who put their hope in pictured images, who say to metal images, You are our gods.
Give ear, you whose ears are shut; and let your eyes be open, you blind, so that you may see.
Who is blind, but my servant? who has his ears stopped, but he whom I send? who is blind as my true one, or who has his ears shut like the Lord's servant?
Seeing much, but keeping nothing in mind; his ears are open, but there is no hearing.
It was the Lord's pleasure, because of his righteousness, to make the teaching great and give it honour.
But this is a people whose property has been taken away from them by force ; they are all taken in holes , and shut up in prisons : they are made prisoners , and no one makes them free ; they are taken by force and no one says
, Give them back .
Who is there among you who will give ear to this? who will give attention to it for the time to come?
Who gave up Jacob to those who took away his goods, and Israel to his attackers? Did not the Lord? he against whom they did wrong, and in whose ways they would not go, turning away from his teaching.
For this reason he let loose on him the heat of his wrath, and his strength was like a flame; and it put fire round about him, but he did not see it; he was burned, but did not take it to heart.
But now, says the Lord your Maker, O Jacob, and your life-giver, O Israel: have no fear, for I have taken up your cause; naming you by your name, I have made you mine.
When you go through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they will not go over you: when you go through the fire, you will not be burned; and the flame will have no power over you.
For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your saviour; I have given Egypt as a price for you, Ethiopia and Seba for you.
Because of your value in my eyes, you have been honoured, and loved by me; so I will give men for you, and peoples for your life.
Have no fear, for I am with you: I will take your seed from the east, and get you together from the west;
I will say to the north, Give them up; and to the south, Do not keep them back; send back my sons from far, and my daughters from the end of the earth;
Every one who is named by my name, and whom I have made for my glory, who has been formed and designed by me.
Send out the blind people who have eyes, and those who have ears, but they are shut.
Let all the nations come together , and let the peoples be present : who among them is able to make this clear , and give us word of earlier things ? let their witnesses come forward , so that they may be seen to be true , and that
they may give ear , and say , It is true .
You are my witnesses , says the Lord , and my servant whom I have taken for myself : so that you may see and have faith in me , and that it may be clear to you that I am he ; before me there was no God formed
, and there will not be after me .
I, even I, am the Lord; and there is no saviour but me.
I gave the word, and made it clear, and there was no strange god among you: for this reason you are my witnesses, says the Lord.
From time long past I am God, and from this day I am he: there is no one who is able to take you out of my hand: when I undertake a thing, by whom will my purpose be changed?
The Lord, who has taken up your cause, the Holy One of Israel, says, Because of you I have sent to Babylon, and made all their seers come south, and the Chaldaeans whose cry is in the ships.
I am the Lord, your Holy One, the Maker of Israel, your King.
This is the word of the Lord, who makes a way in the sea, and a road through the deep waters;
Who sends out the war-carriages and the horses, the army with all its force; they have come down, they will not get up again; like a feebly burning light they are put out.
Give no thought to the things which are past; let the early times go out of your minds.
See, I am doing a new thing; now it is starting; will you not take note of it? I will even make a way in the waste land, and rivers in the dry country.
The beasts of the field will give me honour, the jackals and the ostriches: because I send out waters in the waste land, and rivers in the dry country, to give drink to the people whom I have taken for myself:
Even the people whom I made to be the witnesses of my praise.
But you have made no prayer to me, O Jacob: and you have given no thought to me, O Israel.
You have not made me burned offerings of sheep, or given me honour with your offerings of beasts; I did not make you servants to give me an offering, and I did not make you tired with requests for perfumes.
You have not got me sweet-smelling plants with your money, or given me pleasure with the fat of your offerings: but you have made me a servant to your sins, and you have made me tired with your evil doings.
I, even I, am he who takes away your sins; and I will no longer keep your evil doings in mind.
Put me in mind of this; let us take up the cause between us: put forward your cause, so that you may be seen to be in the right.
Your first father was a sinner, and your guides have gone against my word.
Your chiefs have made my holy place unclean, so I have made Jacob a curse, and Israel a thing of shame.
And now, give ear, O Jacob my servant, and Israel whom I have taken for myself:
The Lord who made you, forming you in your mother's body, the Lord, your helper, says, Have no fear, O Jacob my servant, and you, Jeshurun, whom I have taken for myself.
For I will send water on the land needing it, and streams on the dry earth: I will let my spirit come down on your seed, and my blessing on your offspring.
And they will come up like grass in a well-watered field, like water-plants by the streams.
One will say, I am the Lord's; and another will give himself the name, Jacob; another will put a mark on his hand, I am the Lord's, and another will take the name of Israel for himself.
The Lord, the King of Israel, even the Lord of armies who has taken up his cause, says, I am the first and the last, and there is no God but me.
If there is one like me, let him come forward and say it, let him make it clear and put it in order before me: who has made clear in the past the things to come? let him make clear the future to me.
Have no fear, be strong in heart; have I not made it clear to you in the past, and let you see it? and you are my witnesses. Is there any God but me, or a Rock of whom I have no knowledge?
Those who make a pictured image are all of them as nothing, and the things of their desire will be of no profit to them: and their servants see not, and have no knowledge; so they will be put to shame.
Whoever makes a god, makes nothing but a metal image in which there is no profit.
Truly, all those who make use of secret arts will be put to shame, and their words of power are only words of men: let them all come forward together; they will all be in fear and be put to shame.
The iron-worker is heating the metal in the fire, giving it form with his hammers, and working on it with his strong arm: then for need of food his strength gives way, and for need of water he becomes feeble.
The woodworker is measuring out the wood with his line , marking it out with his pencil : after smoothing it with his plane , and making circles on it with his instrument , he gives it the form and glory of a man , so that it may be
placed in the house .
He has cedars cut down for himself, he takes an oak and lets it get strong among the trees of the wood; he has an ash-tree planted, and the rain gives it growth.
Then it will be used to make a fire , so that a man may get warm ; he has the oven heated with it and makes bread : he makes a god with it , to which he gives worship : he makes a pictured image out of it
, and goes down on his face before it .
With part of it he makes a fire, and on the fire he gets meat cooked and takes a full meal: he makes himself warm, and says, Aha! I am warm, I have seen the fire:
And the rest of it he makes into a god, even his pictured image: he goes down on his face before it, giving worship to it, and making prayer to it, saying, Be my saviour; for you are my god.
They have no knowledge or wisdom; for he has put a veil over their eyes, so that they may not see; and on their hearts, so that they may not give attention.
And no one takes note , no one has enough knowledge or wisdom to say , I have put part of it in the fire , and made bread on it ; I have had a meal of the flesh cooked with it : and am I now to make
the rest of it into a false god ? am I to go down on my face before a bit of wood ?
As for him whose food is the dust of a dead fire, he has been turned from the way by a twisted mind, so that he is unable to keep himself safe by saying, What I have here in my hand is false.
Keep these things in mind, O Jacob; and you Israel, for you are my servant: I have made you; you are my servant; O Israel, I will not let you go out of my memory.
I have put your evil doings out of my mind like a thick cloud, and your sins like a mist: come back to me; for I have taken up your cause.
Make a song , O heavens , for the Lord has done it : give a loud cry , you deep parts of the earth : let your voices be loud in song , you mountains , and you woods with all your trees : for the Lord has taken
up the cause of Jacob , and will let his glory be seen in Israel .
The Lord , who has taken up your cause , and who gave you life in your mother ' s body , says , I am the Lord who makes all things ; stretching out the heavens by myself , and giving the earth its limits ; who was with
me ?
Who makes the signs of those who give word of the future come to nothing, so that those who have knowledge of secret arts go off their heads; turning the wise men back, and making their knowledge foolish:
Who makes the word of his servants certain , and gives effect to the purposes of his representatives ; who says of Jerusalem , Her people will come back to her ; and of the towns of Judah , I will give orders for their building , and will make
her waste places fertile again :
Who says to the deep, Be dry, and I will make your rivers dry:
Who says of Cyrus, He will take care of my sheep, and will do all my pleasure: who says of Jerusalem, I will give the word for your building; and of the Temple, Your bases will be put in place.
The Lord says to the man of his selection , to Cyrus , whom I have taken by the right hand , putting down nations before him , and taking away the arms of kings ; making the doors open before him , so that the ways into the towns
may not be shut ;
I will go before you, and make the rough places level: the doors of brass will be broken, and the iron rods cut in two:
And I will give you the stores of the dark, and the wealth of secret places, so that you may be certain that I am the Lord, who gave you your name, even the God of Israel.
Because of Jacob my servant, and Israel whom I have taken for myself, I have sent for you by name, giving you a name of honour, though you had no knowledge of me.
I am the Lord, and there is no other; there is no God but me: I will make you ready for war, though you had no knowledge of me:
So that they may see from the east and from the west that there is no God but me: I am the Lord, and there is no other.
I am the giver of light and the maker of the dark; causing blessing, and sending troubles; I am the Lord, who does all these things.
Let righteousness come down , O heavens , from on high , and let the sky send it down like rain : let the earth be open to give the fruit of salvation , causing righteousness to come up with it ; I the Lord have made it come about
Cursed is he who has an argument with his Maker , the pot which has an argument with the Potter ! Will the wet earth say to him who is working with it , What are you doing , that your work has nothing by which it may be gripped
Cursed is he who says to a father, To what are you giving life? or to a woman, What are you in birth-pains with?
The Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, says, Will you put a question to me about the things which are to come, or will you give me orders about my sons, and the work of my hands?
I have made the earth, forming man on it: by my hands the heavens have been stretched out, and all the stars put in their ordered places.
I have sent him out to overcome the nations, and I will make all his ways straight: I will give him the work of building my town, and he will let my prisoners go free, without price or reward, says the Lord of armies.
The Lord says , The workmen of Egypt , and the traders of Ethiopia , and the tall Sabaeans , will come over the sea to you , and they will be yours ; they will go after you ; in chains they will come over : and they will
go down on their faces before you , and will make prayer to you , saying , Truly , God is among you ; and there is no other God .
Truly, you have a secret God, the God of Israel is a Saviour!
All those who have gone against him will be put to shame; the makers of images will be made low.
But the Lord will make Israel free with an eternal salvation: you will not be put to shame or made low for ever and ever.
For this is the word of the Lord who made the heavens ; he is God ; the maker and designer of the earth ; who made it not to be a waste , but as a living-place for man : I am the Lord , and there is no
other .
I have not given my word in secret, in a place in the underworld; I did not say to the seed of Jacob, Go into a waste land to make request of me: I the Lord say what is true, my word is righteousness.
Come together, even come near, you nations who are still living: they have no knowledge who take up their image of wood, and make prayer to a god in whom is no salvation.
Give the word , put forward your cause , let us have a discussion together : who has given news of this in the past ? who made it clear in early times ? did not I , the Lord ? and there is no God but me ; a
true God and a saviour ; there is no other .
Let your hearts be turned to me, so that you may have salvation, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is no other.
By myself have I taken an oath, a true word has gone from my mouth, and will not be changed, that to me every knee will be bent, and every tongue will give honour.
Only in the Lord will Jacob overcome and be strong: together all those who were angry with him will be put to shame and come to destruction.
In the Lord will all the seed of Israel get their rights, and they will give glory to him.
Bel is bent down, Nebo is falling; their images are on the beasts and on the cattle: the things which you took about have become a weight to the tired beast.
They are bent down, they are falling together: they were not able to keep their images safe, but they themselves have been taken prisoner.
Give ear to me, O family of Jacob, and all the rest of the people of Israel, who have been supported by me from their birth, and have been my care from their earliest days:
Even when you are old I will be the same, and when you are grey-haired I will take care of you: I will still be responsible for what I made; yes, I will take you and keep you safe.
Who in your eyes is my equal? or what comparison will you make with me?
As for those who take gold out of a bag, and put silver in the scales, they give payment to a gold-worker, to make it into a god; they go down on their faces and give it worship.
They put him on their backs , and take him up , and put him in his fixed place , from which he may not be moved ; if a man gives a cry for help to him , he is unable to give an answer , or get him
out of his trouble .
Keep this in mind and be shamed; let it come back to your memory, you sinners.
Let the things which are past come to your memory: for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is no one like me;
Making clear from the first what is to come, and from past times the things which have not so far come about; saying, My purpose is fixed, and I will do all my pleasure;
Sending for a bird of strong flight from the east, the man of my purpose from a far country; I have said it, and I will give effect to it; the thing designed by me will certainly be done.
Give ear to me, you feeble-hearted, who have no faith in my righteousness:
My righteousness is near, it is not far off; salvation will come quickly; and I will make Zion free, and give Israel my glory.
Come and take your seat in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; come down from your seat of power, and take your place on the earth, O daughter of the Chaldaeans: for you will never again seem soft and delicate.
Take the crushing-stones and get the meal crushed: take off your veil, put away your robe, let your legs be uncovered, go through the rivers.
The shame of your unclothed condition will be seen by all: I will give punishment without mercy,
Says the Lord who takes up our cause; the Lord of armies is his name, the Holy One of Israel.
Be seated in the dark without a word, O daughter of the Chaldaeans: for you will no longer be named, The Queen of Kingdoms.
I was angry with my people, I put shame on my heritage, and gave them into your hands: you had no mercy on them; you put a cruel yoke on those who were old;
And you said, I will be a queen for ever: you did not give attention to these things, and did not keep in mind what would come after.
So now take note of this , you who are given up to pleasure , living without fear of evil , saying in your heart , I am , and there is no one like me ; I will never be a widow , or have my children taken from
me .
But these two things will come on you suddenly in one day, the loss of children and of husband: in full measure they will come on you, for all your secret arts, and all your wonders.
For you had faith in your evil-doing; you said, No one sees me; by your wisdom and knowledge you have been turned out of the way: and you have said in your heart, I am, and there is no other.
Because of this evil will come on you, which may not be turned away for any price: and trouble will overtake you, from which no money will give salvation: destruction will come on you suddenly, without your knowledge.
Go on now with your secret arts, and all your wonder-working, to which you have given yourself up from your earliest days; it may be that they will be of profit to you, or by them you may put fear into your attackers.
But your mind is troubled by the number of your guides : let them now come forward for your salvation : the measurers of the heavens , the watchers of the stars , and those who are able to say from month to month what things are coming on you
Truly , they have become like dry stems , they have been burned in the fire ; they are not able to keep themselves safe from the power of the flame : it is not a coal for warming them , or a fire by which a man may be
seated .
Small profit have you had from those who, from your earliest days, got great profit out of you; they have gone in flight, every one straight before him, and you have no saviour.
Give ear to this , O family of Jacob , you who are named by the name of Israel , and have come out of the body of Judah ; who take oaths by the name of the Lord , and make use of the name of the God of
Israel , but not truly and not in good faith .
For they say that they are of the holy town, and put their faith in the God of Israel: the Lord of armies is his name.
I gave word in the past of the things which came about; they came from my mouth, and I made them clear: suddenly I did them, and they came about.
Because I saw that your heart was hard, and that your neck was an iron cord, and your brow brass;
For this reason I made it clear to you in the past, before it came I gave you word of it: for fear that you might say, My god did these things, and my pictured and metal images made them come about.
All this has come to your ears and you have seen it; will you not give witness to it? I am now making clear new things, even secret things, of which you had no knowledge.
They have only now been effected, and not in the past: and before this day they had not come to your ears; for fear that you might say, I had knowledge of them.
Truly you had no word of them, no knowledge of them; no news of them in the past had come to your ears; because I saw how false was your behaviour, and that your heart was turned against me from your earliest days.
Because of my name I will put away my wrath, and for my praise I will keep myself from cutting you off.
See, I have been testing you for myself like silver; I have put you through the fire of trouble.
For myself, even because of my name, I will do it; for I will not let my name be shamed; and my glory I will not give to another.
Give ear to me, Jacob, and Israel, my loved one; I am he, I am the first and I am the last.
Yes, by my hand was the earth placed on its base, and by my right hand the heavens were stretched out; at my word they take up their places.
Come together, all of you, and give ear; who among you has given news of these things? the Lord's loved one will do his pleasure with Babylon, and with the seed of the Chaldaeans.
I, even I, have given the word; I have sent for him: I have made him come, and have given effect to his undertakings.
Come near to me, and give ear to this; from the start I did not keep it secret; from the time of its coming into existence I was there: and now the Lord God has sent me, and given me his spirit.
The Lord who takes up your cause, the Holy One of Israel, says, I am the Lord your God, who is teaching you for your profit, guiding you by the way in which you are to go.
If only you had given ear to my orders, then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness as the waves of the sea:
Your seed would have been like the sand, and your offspring like the dust: your name would not be cut off or come to an end before me.
Go out of Babylon , go in flight from the Chaldaeans ; with the sound of song make it clear , give the news , let the word go out even to the end of the earth : say , The Lord has taken up the cause of his servant
Jacob .
They had no need of water when he was guiding them through the waste lands: he made water come out of the rock for them: the rock was parted and the waters came flowing out.
There is no peace, says the Lord, for the evil-doers.
Give ear, O sea-lands, to me; and take note, you peoples from far: I have been marked out by the Lord from the first; when I was still in my mother's body, he had my name in mind:
And he has made my mouth like a sharp sword, in the shade of his hand he has kept me; and he has made me like a polished arrow, keeping me in his secret place;
And he said to me, You are my servant, Israel, in whom my glory will be seen;
And I said, I have undergone weariness for nothing, I have given my strength for no purpose or profit: but still the Lord will take up my cause, and my God will give me my reward.
And now , says the Lord , who made me his servant when I was still in my mother ' s body , so that I might make Jacob come back to him , and so that Israel might come together to him : and I was honoured in the
eyes of the Lord , and my God became my strength .
It is not enough for one who is my servant to put the tribes of Jacob again in their place , and to get back those of Israel who have been sent away : my purpose is to give you as a light to the nations , so that you
may be my salvation to the end of the earth .
The Lord who takes up Israel ' s cause , even his Holy One , says to him whom men make sport of , who is hated by the nations , a servant of rulers : Kings will see and get up from their places , and chiefs will give
worship : because of the Lord who keeps faith ; even the Holy One of Israel who has taken you for himself .
This is the word of the Lord : I have given ear to you at a good time , and I have been your helper in a day of salvation : and I will keep you safe , and will make you a glory for the people , putting the
land in order , and giving them the heritages which now are waste ;
Saying to those who are in chains, Go free; to those who are in the dark, Come out into the light. They will get food by the way wherever they go, and have grass-lands on all the dry mountain-tops.
They will not be in need of food or drink, or be troubled by the heat or the sun: for he who has mercy on them will be their guide, taking them by the springs of water.
And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways will be lifted up.
See, these are coming from far; and these from the north and the west; and these from the land of Sinim.
Let your voice be loud in song, O heavens; and be glad, O earth; make sounds of joy, O mountains, for the Lord has given comfort to his people, and will have mercy on his crushed ones.
But Zion said, The Lord has given me up, I have gone from his memory.
Will a woman give up the child at her breast, will she be without pity for the fruit of her body? yes, these may, but I will not let you go out of my memory.
See, your name is marked on my hands; your walls are ever before me.
Your builders are coming quickly; your haters and those who made you waste will go out of you.
Let your eyes be lifted up round about, and see: they are all coming together to you. By my life, says the Lord, truly you will put them all on you as an ornament, and be clothed with them like a bride.
For though the waste places of your land have been given to destruction, now you will not be wide enough for your people, and those who made you waste will be far away.
The children to whom you gave birth in other lands will say in your ears, The place is not wide enough for me: make room for me to have a resting-place.
Then you will say in your heart , Who has given me all these children ? when my children had been taken from me , and I was no longer able to have others , who took care of these ? when I was by myself , where then were
these ?
This is the word of the Lord God: See, I will make a sign with my hand to the nations, and put up my flag for the peoples; and they will take up your sons on their beasts, and your daughters on their backs.
And kings will take care of you , and queens will give you their milk : they will go down on their faces before you , kissing the dust of your feet ; and you will be certain that I am the Lord , and that those who put their
hope in me will not be shamed .
Will the goods of war be taken from the strong man, or the prisoners of the cruel one be let go?
But the Lord says, Even the prisoners of the strong will be taken from him, and the cruel made to let go his goods: for I will take up your cause against your haters, and I will keep your children safe.
And the flesh of your attackers will be taken by themselves for food ; and they will take their blood for drink , as if it was sweet wine : and all men will see that I the Lord am your saviour , even he who takes up your cause
, the Strong One of Jacob .
Let me make a song about my loved one, a song of love for his vine-garden. My loved one had a vine-garden on a fertile hill:
And after working the earth of it with a spade , he took away its stones , and put in it a very special vine ; and he put up a watchtower in the middle of it , hollowing out in the rock a place for the grape-crushing ; and
he was hoping that it would give the best grapes , but it gave common grapes .
And now, you people of Jerusalem and you men of Judah, be the judges between me and my vine-garden.
Is there anything which might have been done for my vine-garden which I have not done? why then, when I was hoping for the best grapes did it give me common grapes?
And now, this is what I will do to my vine-garden: I will take away the circle of thorns round it, and it will be burned up; its wall will be broken down and the beasts of the field will go through it;
And I will make it waste; its branches will not be touched with the knife, or the earth worked with the spade; but blackberries and thorns will come up in it: and I will give orders to the clouds not to send rain on it.
For the vine-garden of the Lord of armies is the people of Israel, and the men of Judah are the plant of his delight: and he was looking for upright judging, and there was blood; for righteousness, and there was a cry for help.
Cursed are those who are joining house to house, and putting field to field, till there is no more living-space for any but themselves in all the land!
The Lord of armies has said to me secretly, Truly, numbers of great and fair houses will be waste, with no one living in them.
For ten fields of vines will only give one measure of wine, and a great amount of seed will only give a small measure of grain.
Cursed are those who get up early in the morning to give themselves up to strong drink; who keep on drinking far into the night till they are heated with wine!
And corded instruments and wind-instruments and wine are in their feasts: but they give no thought to the work of the Lord, and they are not interested in what his hands are doing.
For this cause my people are taken away as prisoners into strange countries for need of knowledge: and their rulers are wasted for need of food, and their loud-voiced feasters are dry for need of water.
For this cause the underworld has made wide its throat, opening its mouth without limit: and her glory, and the noise of her masses, and her loud-voiced feasters, will go down into it.
And the poor man's head is bent, and the great man goes down on his face, and the eyes of pride are put to shame:
But the Lord of armies is lifted up as judge, and the Holy God is seen to be holy in righteousness.
Then the lambs will get food as in their grass-lands, and the fat cattle will be feasting in the waste places.
Cursed are those who make use of ox-cords for pulling the evil thing, and the bands of a young ox for their sin!
Who say, Let him do his work quickly, let him make it sudden, so that we may see it: let the design of the Holy One of Israel come near, so that it may be clear to us.
Cursed are those who give the name of good to evil, and of evil to what is good: who make light dark, and dark light: who make bitter sweet, and sweet bitter!
Cursed are those who seem wise to themselves, and who take pride in their knowledge!
Cursed are those who are strong to take wine, and great in making mixed drinks!
Who for a reward give support to the cause of the sinner, and who take away the righteousness of the upright from him.
For this cause , as the waste of the grain is burned up by tongues of fire , and as the dry grass goes down before the flame , so their root will be like the dry stems of grain , and their flower will go up in dust :
because they have gone against the law of the Lord of armies , and have given no honour to the word of the Holy One of Israel .
For this reason the wrath of the Lord has been burning against his people, and his hand has been stretched out against them in punishment, and the hills were shaking, and their dead bodies were like waste in the open places of the town.
And he will let a flag be lifted up as a sign to a far-off nation, whistling to them from the ends of the earth: and they will come quickly and suddenly.
There is no weariness among them, and no man is feeble-footed: they come without resting or sleeping, and the cord of their shoes is not broken.
Their arrows are sharp, and every bow is bent: the feet of their horses are like rock, and their wheels are like a rushing storm.
The sound of their armies will be like the voice of a lion , and their war-cry like the noise of young lions : with loud cries they will come down on their food and will take it away safely , and there will be no one to take it
out of their hands .
And his voice will be loud over him in that day like the sounding of the sea: and if a man's eyes are turned to the earth, it is all dark and full of trouble; and the light is made dark by thick clouds.
This is the word of the Lord : Where is the statement which I gave your mother when I put her away ? or to which of my creditors have I given you for money ? It was for your sins that you were given into the hands of others
, and for your evil-doing was your mother put away .
Why , then , when I came , was there no man ? and no one to give answer to my voice ? has my hand become feeble , so that it is unable to take up your cause ? or have I no power to make you free ?
See , at my word the sea becomes dry , I make the rivers a waste land : their fish are dead for need of water , and make an evil smell .
By me the heavens are clothed with black, and I make haircloth their robe.
The Lord God has given me the tongue of those who are experienced, so that I may be able to give the word a special sense for the feeble: every morning my ear is open to his teaching, like those who are experienced:
And I have not put myself against him, or let my heart be turned back from him.
I was offering my back to those who gave me blows, and my face to those who were pulling out my hair: I did not keep my face covered from marks of shame.
For the Lord God is my helper; I will not be put to shame: so I have made my face like a rock, and I am certain that he will give me my right.
He who takes up my cause is near; who will go to law with me? let us come together before the judge: who is against me? let him come near to me.
See, the Lord God is my helper; who will give a decision against me? truly, all of them will become old like a robe; they will be food for the worm.
Who among you has the fear of the Lord, giving ear to the voice of his servant who has been walking in the dark and has no light? Let him put his faith in the name of the Lord, looking to his God for support.
See, all you who make a fire, arming yourselves with burning branches: go in the flame of your fire, and among the branches you have put a light to. This will you have from my hand, you will make your bed in sorrow.
Give ear to me, you who are searching for righteousness, who are looking for the Lord: see the rock from which you were cut out, and the hole out of which you were taken.
Let your thoughts be turned to Abraham, your father, and to Sarah, who gave you birth: for when he was but one, my voice came to him, and I gave him my blessing, and made him a great people.
For the Lord has given comfort to Zion : he has made glad all her broken walls ; making her waste places like Eden , and changing her dry land into the garden of the Lord ; joy and delight will be there , praise and the sound of melody
Give attention to me, O my people; and give ear to me, O my nation; for teaching will go out from me, and the knowledge of the true God will be a light to the peoples.
Suddenly will my righteousness come near, and my salvation will be shining out like the light; the sea-lands will be waiting for me, and they will put their hope in my strong arm.
Let your eyes be lifted up to the heavens , and turned to the earth which is under them : for the heavens will go in flight like smoke , and the earth will become old like a coat , and its people will come to destruction like insects :
but my salvation will be for ever , and my righteousness will not come to an end .
Give ear to me, you who have knowledge of righteousness, in whose heart is my law; have no fear of the evil words of men, and give no thought to their curses.
For like a coat they will be food for the insect, the worm will make a meal of them like wool: but my righteousness will be for ever, and my salvation to all generations.
Awake! awake! put on strength, O arm of the Lord, awake! as in the old days, in the generations long past. Was it not by you that Rahab was cut in two, and the dragon Wounded?
Did you not make the sea dry, the waters of the great deep? did you not make the deep waters of the sea a way for the Lord's people to go through?
Those whom the Lord has made free will come back with songs to Zion; and on their heads will be eternal joy: delight and joy will be theirs, and sorrow and sounds of grief will be gone for ever.
I, even I, am your comforter: are you so poor in heart as to be in fear of man who will come to an end, and of the son of man who will be like grass?
And you have given no thought to the Lord your Maker , by whom the heavens were stretched out , and the earth placed on its base ; and you went all day in fear of the wrath of the cruel one , when he was making ready for your
destruction . And where is the wrath of the cruel one ?
The prisoner, bent under his chain, will quickly be made free, and will not go down into the underworld, and his bread will not come to an end.
For I am the Lord your God, who makes the sea calm when its waves are thundering: the Lord of armies is his name.
And I have put my words in your mouth, covering you with the shade of my hand, stretching out the heavens, and placing the earth on its base, and saying to Zion, You are my people.
Awake! awake! up! O Jerusalem, you who have taken from the Lord's hand the cup of his wrath; tasting in full measure the wine which overcomes.
She has no one among all her children to be her guide; not one of the sons she has taken care of takes her by the hand.
These two things have come on you; who will be weeping for you? wasting and destruction; death from need of food, and from the sword; how may you be comforted?
Your sons are overcome, like a roe in a net; they are full of the wrath of the Lord, the punishment of your God.
So now give ear to this, you who are troubled and overcome, but not with wine:
This is the word of the Lord your master , even your God who takes up the cause of his people : See , I have taken out of your hand the cup which overcomes , even the cup of my wrath ; it will not again be given to
you :
And I will put it into the hand of your cruel masters , and of those whose yoke has been hard on you ; who have said to your soul , Down on your face ! so that we may go over you : and you have given your backs
like the earth , even like the street , for them to go over .
Awake! awake! put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful robes, O Jerusalem, the holy town: for from now there will never again come into you the unclean and those without circumcision.
Make yourself clean from the dust; up! and take the seat of your power, O Jerusalem: the bands of your neck are loose, O prisoned daughter of Zion.
For the Lord says, You were given for nothing, and you will be made free without price.
For the Lord God says, My people went down at first into Egypt, to get a place for themselves there: and the Assyrian put a cruel yoke on them without cause.
Now then, what have I here? says the Lord, for my people are taken away without cause; they are made waste and give cries of sorrow, says the Lord, and all the day the nations put shame on my name.
For this cause I will make my name clear to my people; in that day they will be certain that it is my word which comes to them; see, here am I.
How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who comes with good news, who gives word of peace, saying that salvation is near; who says to Zion, Your God is ruling!
The voice of your watchmen! their voices are loud in song together; for they will see him, eye to eye, when the Lord comes back to Zion.
Give sounds of joy, make melody together, waste places of Jerusalem: for the Lord has given comfort to his people, he has taken up the cause of Jerusalem.
The Lord has let his holy arm be seen by the eyes of all nations; and all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God.
Away! away! go out from there, touching no unclean thing; go out from among her; be clean, you who take up the vessels of the Lord.
For you will not go out suddenly, and you will not go in flight: for the Lord will go before you, and the God of Israel will come after you to keep you.
See, my servant will do well in his undertakings, he will be honoured, and lifted up, and be very high.
As peoples were surprised at him, And his face was not beautiful, so as to be desired: his face was so changed by disease as to be unlike that of a man, and his form was no longer that of the sons of men.
So will nations give him honour; kings will keep quiet because of him: for what had not been made clear to them they will see; and they will give their minds to what had not come to their ears.
Who would have had faith in the word which has come to our ears, and to whom had the arm of the Lord been unveiled?
For his growth was like that of a delicate plant before him, and like a root out of a dry place: he had no grace of form, to give us pleasure;
Men made sport of him, turning away from him; he was a man of sorrows, marked by disease; and like one from whom men's faces are turned away, he was looked down on, and we put no value on him.
But it was our pain he took, and our diseases were put on him: while to us he seemed as one diseased, on whom God's punishment had come.
But it was for our sins he was wounded, and for our evil doings he was crushed: he took the punishment by which we have peace, and by his wounds we are made well.
We all went wandering like sheep; going every one of us after his desire; and the Lord put on him the punishment of us all.
Men were cruel to him, but he was gentle and quiet; as a lamb taken to its death, and as a sheep before those who take her wool makes no sound, so he said not a word.
They took away from him help and right, and who gave a thought to his fate? for he was cut off from the land of the living: he came to his death for the sin of my people.
And they put his body into the earth with sinners, and his last resting-place was with the evil-doers, though he had done no wrong, and no deceit was in his mouth.
And the Lord was pleased ... see a seed, long life, ... will do well in his hand. ...
... made clear his righteousness before men ... had taken their sins on himself.
For this cause he will have a heritage with the great , and he will have a part in the goods of war with the strong , because he gave up his life , and was numbered with the evil-doers ; taking on himself the sins of the people ,
and making prayer for the wrongdoers .
Let your voice be loud in song, O woman without children; make melody and sounds of joy, you who did not give birth: for the children of her who had no husband are more than those of the married wife, says the Lord.
Make wide the place of your tent, and let the curtains of your house be stretched out without limit: make your cords long, and your tent-pins strong.
For I will make wide your limits on the right hand and on the left; and your seed will take the nations for a heritage, and make the waste towns full of people.
Have no fear ; for you will not be shamed or without hope : you will not be put to shame , for the shame of your earlier days will go out of your memory , and you will no longer keep in mind the sorrows of your widowed years
For your Maker is your husband; the Lord of armies is his name: and the Holy One of Israel is he who takes up your cause; he will be named the God of all the earth.
For the Lord has made you come back to him, like a wife who has been sent away in grief of spirit; for one may not give up the wife of one's early days.
For a short time I gave you up; but with great mercies I will take you back again.
In overflowing wrath my face was veiled from you for a minute, but I will have pity on you for ever, says the Lord who takes up your cause.
For this is like the days of Noah to me : for as I took an oath that the waters of Noah would never again go over the earth , so have I taken an oath that I will not again be angry with you , or say bitter words
to you .
For the mountains may be taken away, and the hills be moved out of their places, but my love will not be taken from you, or my agreement of peace broken, says the Lord, who has had mercy on you.
O troubled one, storm-crushed, uncomforted! see, your stones will be framed in fair colours, and your bases will be sapphires.
I will make your towers of rubies, and your doors of carbuncles, and the wall round you will be of all sorts of beautiful stones.
And all your builders will be made wise by the Lord; and great will be the peace of your children.
All your rights will be made certain to you: have no fear of evil, and destruction will not come near you.
See, they may be moved to war, but not by my authority: all those who come together to make an attack on you, will be broken against you.
See, I have made the iron-worker, blowing on the burning coals, and making the instrument of war by his work; and I have made the waster for destruction.
No instrument of war which is formed against you will be of any use; and every tongue which says evil against you will be judged false. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness comes from me, says the Lord.
Ho! everyone in need, come to the waters, and he who has no strength, let him get food: come, get bread without money; wine and milk without price.
Why do you give your money for what is not bread, and the fruit of your work for what will not give you pleasure? Give ear to me, so that your food may be good, and you may have the best in full measure.
Give ear, and come to me, take note with care, so that your souls may have life: and I will make an eternal agreement with you, even the certain mercies of David.
See, I have given him as a witness to the peoples, a ruler and a guide to the nations.
See , you will send for a nation of which you had no knowledge , and those who had no knowledge of you will come running to you , because of the Lord your God , and because of the Holy One of Israel , for he has given you
glory .
Make search for the Lord while he is there, make prayer to him while he is near:
Let the sinner give up his way, and the evil-doer his purpose: and let him come back to the Lord, and he will have mercy on him; and to our God, for there is full forgiveness with him.
For my thoughts are not your thoughts, or your ways my ways, says the Lord.
For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and does not go back again, but gives water to the earth, and makes it fertile, giving seed to the planter, and bread for food;
So will my word be which goes out of my mouth: it will not come back to me with nothing done, but it will give effect to my purpose, and do that for which I have sent it.
For you will go out with joy, and be guided in peace: the mountains and the hills will make melody before you, and all the trees of the fields will make sounds of joy.
In place of the thorn will come up the fir-tree, and in place of the blackberry the myrtle: and it will be to the Lord for a name, for an eternal sign which will not be cut off.
The Lord says, Let your way of life be upright, and let your behaviour be rightly ordered: for my salvation is near, and my righteousness will quickly be seen.
Happy is the man who does this, and the son of man whose behaviour is so ordered; who keeps the Sabbath holy, and his hand from doing any evil.
And let not the man from a strange country, who has been joined to the Lord, say, The Lord will certainly put a division between me and his people: and let not the unsexed man say, See, I am a dry tree.
For the Lord says, As for the unsexed who keep my Sabbaths, and give their hearts to pleasing me, and keep their agreement with me:
I will give to them in my house, and inside my walls, a place and a name better than that of sons and daughters; I will give them an eternal name which will not be cut off.
And as for those from a strange country, who are joined to the Lord, to give worship to him and honour to his name, to be his servants, even everyone who keeps the Sabbath holy, and keeps his agreement with me:
I will make them come to my holy mountain, and will give them joy in my house of prayer; I will take pleasure in the burned offerings which they make on my altar: for my house will be named a house of prayer for all peoples.
The Lord God, who gets together the wandering ones of Israel, says, I will get together others in addition to those of Israel who have come back.
All you beasts of the field, come together for your meat, even all you beasts of the wood.
His watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge; they are all dogs without tongues, unable to make a sound; stretched out dreaming, loving sleep.
Yes, the dogs are for ever looking for food; while these, the keepers of the sheep, are without wisdom: they have all gone after their pleasure, every one looking for profit; they are all the same.
Come, they say, I will get wine, and we will take strong drink in full measure; and tomorrow will be like today, full of pleasure.
The upright man goes to his death, and no one gives a thought to it; and god-fearing men are taken away, and no one is troubled by it; for the upright man is taken away because of evil-doing, and goes into peace.
They are at rest in their last resting-places, every one going straight before him.
But come near, you sons of her who is wise in secret arts, the seed of her who is false to her husband, and of the loose woman.
Of whom do you make sport? against whom is your mouth open wide and your tongue put out? are you not uncontrolled children, a false seed,
You who are burning with evil desire among the oaks, under every green tree; putting children to death in the valleys, under the cracks of the rocks?
Among the smooth stones of the valley is your heritage; they, even they, are your part: even to them have you made a drink offering and a meal offering. Is it possible for such things to be overlooked by me?
You have put your bed on a high mountain: there you went up to make your offering.
And on the back of the doors and on the pillars you have put your sign : for you have been false to me with another ; you have made your bed wide , and made an agreement with them ; you had a desire for their bed where you
saw it
And you went to Melech with oil and much perfume, and you sent your representatives far off, and went as low as the underworld.
You were tired with your long journeys; but you did not say, There is no hope: you got new strength, and so you were not feeble.
And of whom were you in fear, so that you were false, and did not keep me in mind, or give thought to it? Have I not been quiet, keeping myself secret, and so you were not in fear of me?
I will make clear what your righteousness is like and your works; you will have no profit in them.
Your false gods will not keep you safe in answer to your cry ; but the wind will take them , they will be gone like a breath : but he who puts his hope in me will take the land , and will have my holy mountain as his
heritage .
And I will say, Make it high, make it high, get ready the way, take the stones out of the way of my people.
For this is the word of him who is high and lifted up , whose resting-place is eternal , whose name is Holy : my resting-place is in the high and holy place , and with him who is crushed and poor in spirit , to give life to the
spirit of the poor , and to make strong the heart of the crushed .
For I will not give punishment for ever, or be angry without end: for from me breath goes out; and I it was who made the souls.
I was quickly angry with his evil ways, and sent punishment on him, veiling my face in wrath: and he went on, turning his heart from me.
I have seen his ways, and I will make him well: I will give him rest, comforting him and his people who are sad.
I will give the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him who is near and to him who is far off, says the Lord; and I will make him well.
But the evil-doers are like the troubled sea, for which there is no rest, and its waters send up earth and waste.
There is no peace, says my God, for the evil-doers.
Make a loud cry, do not be quiet, let your voice be sounding like a horn, and make clear to my people their evil doings, and to the family of Jacob their sins.
Though they make prayer to me every day , and take pleasure in the knowledge of my ways : like a nation which has done righteousness , and has not given up the rules of their God , they make requests to me for the right orders , it is
their delight to come near to God .
They say , Why have we kept ourselves from food , and you do not see it ? why have we kept ourselves from pleasure , and you take no note of it ? If , in the days when you keep from food , you take the chance to
do your business , and get in your debts ;
If keeping from food makes you quickly angry, ready for fighting and giving blows with evil hands; your holy days are not such as to make your voice come to my ears on high.
Have I given orders for such a day as this ? a day for keeping yourselves from pleasure ? is it only a question of the bent head , of putting on haircloth , and being seated in the dust ? is this what seems to you a holy day
, well-pleasing to the Lord ?
Is not this the holy day for which I have given orders: to let loose those who have wrongly been made prisoners, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the crushed go free, and every yoke be broken?
Is it not to give your bread to those in need , and to let the poor who have no resting-place come into your house ? to put a robe on the unclothed one when you see him , and not to keep your eyes shut for fear of seeing
his flesh ?
Then will light be shining on you like the morning, and your wounds will quickly be well: and your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the Lord will come after you.
Then at the sound of your voice, the Lord will give an answer; at your cry he will say, Here am I. If you take away from among you the yoke, the putting out of the finger of shame, and the evil word;
And if you give your bread to those in need of it, so that the troubled one may have his desire; then you will have light in the dark, and your night will be as the full light of the sun:
And the Lord will be your guide at all times; in dry places he will give you water in full measure, and will make strong your bones; and you will be like a watered garden, and like an ever-flowing spring.
And your sons will be building again the old waste places: you will make strong the bases of old generations: and you will be named, He who puts up the broken walls, and, He who makes ready the ways for use.
If you keep the Sabbath with care , not doing your business on my holy day ; and if the Sabbath seems to you a delight , and the new moon of the Lord a thing to be honoured ; and if you give respect to him by not doing
your business , or going after your pleasure , or saying unholy words ;
Then the Lord will be your delight; and I will put you on the high places of the earth; and I will give you the heritage of Jacob your father: for the mouth of the Lord has said it.
Truly, the Lord's hand has not become short, so that he is unable to give salvation; and his ear is not shut from hearing:
But your sins have come between you and your God, and by your evil doings his face has been veiled from you, so that he will give you no answer.
For your hands are unclean with blood, and your fingers with sin; your lips have said false things, and your tongue gives out deceit.
No one puts forward an upright cause, or gives a true decision: their hope is in deceit, and their words are false; they are with child with sin, and give birth to evil.
They give birth to snake's eggs, and make spider's threads: whoever takes their eggs for food comes to his death, and the egg which is crushed becomes a poison-snake.
Their twisted threads will not make clothing, and their works will give them nothing for covering themselves: their works are works of sin, and violent acts are in their hands.
Their feet go quickly to evil, and they take delight in the death of the upright; their thoughts are thoughts of sin; wasting and destruction are in their ways.
They have no knowledge of the way of peace, and there is no sense of what is right in their behaviour: they have made for themselves ways which are not straight; whoever goes in them has no knowledge of peace.
For this cause our right is far from us, and righteousness does not overtake us: we are looking for light, but there is only the dark; for the shining of the sun, but our way is in the night.
We go on our way, like blind men feeling for the wall, even like those who have no eyes: we are running against things in daylight as if it was evening; our place is in the dark like dead men.
We make noises of grief, like bears, and sad sounds like doves: we are looking for our right, but it is not there; for salvation, but it is far from us.
For our evil doings are increased before you, and our sins give witness against us: for our evil doings are with us, and we have knowledge of our sins:
We have gone against the Lord, and been false to him, turning away from our God, our words have been uncontrolled, and in our hearts are thoughts of deceit.
And the right is turned back, and righteousness is far away: for good faith is not to be seen in the public places, and upright behaviour may not come into the town.
Yes, faith is gone; and he whose heart is turned from evil comes into the power of the cruel: and the Lord saw it, and he was angry that there was no one to take up their cause.
And he saw that there was no man, and was surprised that there was no one to take up their cause: so his arm gave salvation, and he made righteousness his support.
Yes, he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and salvation as a head-dress; and he put on punishment as clothing, and wrath as a robe.
He will give them the right reward of their doings, wrath to his attackers, punishment to his haters, and even on the sea-lands he will send punishment.
So they will see the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the east: for he will come like a rushing stream, forced on by a wind of the Lord.
And as a saviour he will come to Zion, turning away sin from Jacob, says the Lord.
And as for me , this is my agreement with them , says the Lord : my spirit which is on you , and my words which I have put in your mouth , will not go away from your mouth , or from the mouth of your seed ,
or from the mouth of your seed ' s seed , says the Lord , from now and for ever .
In the year of King Uzziah's death I saw the Lord seated in his place, high and lifted up, and the Temple was full of the wide skirts of his robe.
Over him were the winged ones: every one had six wings; two for covering his face, two for covering his feed, and two for flight.
And one said in a loud voice to another, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of armies: all the earth is full of his glory.
And the bases of the door-pillars were shaking at the sound of his cry, and the house was full of smoke.
Then I said, The curse is on me, and my fate is destruction; for I am a man of unclean lips, living among a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of armies.
Then a winged one came to me with a burning coal in his hand, which he had taken from off the altar with the fire-spoon.
And after touching my mouth with it, he said, See, your lips have been touched with this; and your evil is taken away, and you are made clean from sin.
And the voice of the Lord came to my ears, saying, Whom am I to send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I, send me.
And he said, Go, and say to this people, You will go on hearing, but learning nothing; you will go on seeing, but without getting wiser.
Make the hearts of this people fat , and let their ears be stopped , and their eyes shut ; for fear that they may see with their eyes , and be hearing with their ears , and their heart may become wise , and they may be turned to
me and made well .
Then I said, Lord, how long? And he said in answer, Till the towns are waste and unpeopled, and the houses have no men, and the land becomes completely waste,
And the Lord has taken men far away, and there are wide waste places in the land.
And even if there is still a tenth part in it, it will again be burned, like a tree of the woods whose broken end is still in the earth after the tree has been cut down (the holy seed is the broken end).
Up! let your face be bright, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord is shining on you.
For truly, the earth will be dark, and the peoples veiled in blackest night; but the Lord will be shining on you, and his glory will be seen among you.
And nations will come to your light, and kings to your bright dawn.
Let your eyes be lifted up, and see: they are all coming together to you: your sons will come from far, and your daughters taken with loving care.
Then you will see, and be bright with joy, and your heart will be shaking with increase of delight: for the produce of the sea will be turned to you, the wealth of the nations will come to you.
You will be full of camel-trains, even the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all from Sheba will come, with gold and spices, giving word of the great acts of the Lord.
All the flocks of Kedar will come together to you, the sheep of Nebaioth will be ready for your need; they will be pleasing offerings on my altar, and my house of prayer will be beautiful.
Who are these coming like a cloud, like a flight of doves to their windows?
Vessels of the sea-lands are waiting for me , and the ships of Tarshish first , so that your sons may come from far , and their silver and gold with them , to the place of the name of the Lord your God , and to the Holy One
of Israel , because he has made you beautiful .
And men from strange countries will be building up your walls, and their kings will be your servants: for in my wrath I sent punishment on you, but in my grace I have had mercy on you.
Your doors will be open at all times; they will not be shut day or night; so that men may come into you with the wealth of the nations, with their kings at their head.
For the nation or kingdom which will not be your servant will come to destruction; such nations will be completely waste.
The glory of Lebanon will come to you, the cypress, the plane, and the sherbin-tree together, to make my holy place beautiful; and the resting-place of my feet will be full of glory.
And the sons of those who were cruel to you will come before you with bent heads ; and those who made sport of you will go down on their faces at your feet ; and you will be named , The Town of the Lord , The Zion of
the Holy One of Israel .
And though you were turned away from, and hated, and had no helper, I will make you a pride for ever, a joy from generation to generation.
And you will take the milk of the nations, flowing from the breast of kings; and you will see that I, the Lord, am your saviour, and he who takes up your cause, the Strong One of Jacob.
In place of brass, I will give gold, and for iron silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron: and I will make Peace your judge, and Righteousness your overseer.
Violent acts will no longer be seen in your land, wasting or destruction in your limits; but your walls will be named, Salvation, and your doors Praise.
The sun will not be your light by day, and the moon will no longer be bright for you by night: but the Lord will be to you an eternal light, and your God your glory.
Your sun will never again go down, or your moon keep back her light: for the Lord will be your eternal light, and the days of your sorrow will be ended.
Your people will all be upright, the land will be their heritage for ever; the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, to be for my glory.
The smallest of their families will become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I, the Lord, will make it come quickly in its time.
The spirit of the Lord is on me , because I am marked out by him to give good news to the poor ; he has sent me to make the broken-hearted well , to say that the prisoners will be made free , and that those in chains will
see the light again ;
To give knowledge that the year of the Lord's good pleasure has come, and the day of punishment from our God; to give comfort to all who are sad;
To give them a fair head-dress in place of dust , the oil of joy in place of the clothing of grief , praise in place of sorrow ; so that they may be named trees of righteousness , the planting of the Lord , and so that he may
have glory .
And they will be building again the old broken walls, and will make new the old waste places, and will put up again the towns which have been waste for long generations.
And men from strange countries will be your herdsmen, and those who are not Israelites will be your ploughmen and vine-keepers.
But you will be named the priests of the Lord, the servants of our God: you will have the wealth of the nations for your food, and you will be clothed with their glory.
As they had twice as much grief, and marks of shame were their heritage, so in their land they will be rewarded twice over, and will have eternal joy.
For I, the Lord, take pleasure in upright judging; I will not put up with the violent taking away of right; and I will certainly give them their reward, and I will make an eternal agreement with them.
And their seed will be noted among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples: it will be clear to all who see them that they are the seed to which the Lord has given his blessing.
I will be full of joy in the Lord , my soul will be glad in my God ; for he has put on me the clothing of salvation , covering me with the robe of righteousness , as the husband puts on a fair head-dress , and the bride
makes herself beautiful with jewels .
For as the earth puts out buds, and as the garden gives growth to the seeds which are planted in it, so the Lord will make righteousness and praise to be flowering before all the nations.
Because of Zion I will not keep quiet, and because of Jerusalem I will take no rest, till her righteousness goes out like the shining of the sun, and her salvation like a burning light.
And the nations will see your righteousness, and all kings your glory: and you will have a new name, given by the mouth of the Lord.
And you will be a fair crown in the hand of the Lord, and a king's head-dress in the hand of your God.
You will not now be named , She who is given up ; and your land will no longer be named , The waste land : but you will have the name , My pleasure is in her , and your land will be named , Married : for the
Lord has pleasure in you , and your land will be married .
For as a young man takes a virgin for his wife, so will your maker be married to you: and as a husband has joy in his bride, so will the Lord your God be glad over you.
I have put watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem; they will not keep quiet day or night: you who are the Lord's recorders, take no rest,
And give him no rest, till he puts Jerusalem in her place to be praised in the earth.
The Lord has taken an oath by his right hand , and by the arm of his strength , Truly , I will no longer give your grain to be food for your haters ; and men of strange countries will not take the wine for which your work has
been done :
But those who have got in the grain will have it for their food, and will give praise to the Lord; and those who have got in the grapes will take the wine of them in the open places of my holy house.
Go through, go through the doors; make ready the way of the people; let the highway be lifted up; let the stones be taken away; let a flag be lifted up over the peoples.
The Lord has sent out word to the end of the earth, Say to the daughter of Zion, See, your saviour comes; those whom he has made free are with him, and those to whom he has given salvation go before him.
And they will be named, The holy people, Those whose cause has been taken up by the Lord: and you will be named, Desired, A town not given up.
Who is this who comes from Edom, with blood-red robes from Bozrah? he whose clothing is fair, stepping with pride in his great strength? I whose glory is in the right, strong for salvation.
Why is your clothing red, and why are your robes like those of one who is crushing the grapes?
I have been crushing the grapes by myself , and of the peoples there was no man with me : in my wrath and in my passion , they were crushed under my feet ; and my robes are marked with their life-blood , and all my clothing is red
For the day of punishment is in my heart, and the year for the payment of the price for my people has come.
And I saw that there was no helper, and I was wondering that no one gave them support: so my arm did the work of salvation, and my wrath was my support.
And in my passion the peoples were crushed under my feet, and broken in my wrath, and I put down their strength to the earth.
I will give news of the mercies of the Lord, and his great acts, even all the things the Lord has done for us, in his great grace to the house of Israel; even all he has done for us in his unnumbered mercies.
For he said, Truly they are my people, children who will not be false: so he was their saviour out of all their trouble.
It was no sent one or angel, but he himself who was their saviour: in his love and in his pity he took up their cause, and he took them in his arms, caring for them all through the years.
But they went against him, causing grief to his holy spirit: so he was turned against them, and made war on them.
Then the early days came to their minds, the days of Moses his servant: and they said, Where is he who made the keeper of his flock come up from the sea? where is he who put his holy spirit among them,
He who made the arm of his glory go at the right hand of Moses, by whom the waters were parted before them, to make himself an eternal name;
He who made them go through the deep waters, like a horse in the waste land?
Like the cattle which go down into the valley, they went without falling, the spirit of the Lord guiding them: so you went before your people, to make yourself a great name.
Let your eyes be looking down from heaven, from your holy and beautiful house: where is your deep feeling, the working of your power? do not keep back the moving of your pity and your mercies:
For you are our father, though Abraham has no knowledge of us, and Israel gives no thought to us: you, O Lord, are our father; from the earliest days you have taken up our cause.
O Lord, why do you send us wandering from your ways, making our hearts hard, so that we have no fear of you? Come back, because of your servants, the tribes of your heritage.
Why have evil men gone over your holy place, so that it has been crushed under the feet of our haters?
We have become as those who were never ruled by you, on whom your name was not named.
O let the heavens be broken open and come down, so that the mountains may be shaking before you,
As when fire puts the brushwood in flames, or as when water is boiling from the heat of the fire: to make your name feared by your haters, so that the nations may be shaking before you;
While you do acts of power for which we are not looking, and which have not come to the ears of men in the past.
The ear has not had news of, or the eye seen, ... any God but you, working for the man who is waiting for him.
Will you not have mercy on him who takes pleasure in doing righteousness, even on those who keep in mind your ways? Truly you were angry, and we went on doing evil, and sinning against you in the past.
For we have all become like an unclean person, and all our good acts are like a dirty robe: and we have all become old like a dead leaf, and our sins, like the wind, take us away.
And there is no one who makes prayer to your name, or who is moved to keep true to you: for your face is veiled from us, and you have given us into the power of our sins.
But now, O Lord, you are our father; we are the earth, and you are our maker; and we are all the work of your hand.
Be not very angry, O Lord, and do not keep our sins in mind for ever: give ear to our prayer, for we are all your people.
Your holy towns have become a waste, Zion has become a waste, Jerusalem is a mass of broken walls.
Our holy and beautiful house, where our fathers gave praise to you, is burned with fire; and all the things of our desire have come to destruction.
In view of all this, will you still do nothing, O Lord? will you keep quiet, and go on increasing our punishment?
I have been ready to give an answer to those who did not make prayer to me ; I have been offering myself to those who were not searching for me ; I said , Here am I , here am I , to a nation which gave no respect
to my name .
All day my hands have been stretched out to an uncontrolled people, who go in an evil way, after the purposes of their hearts;
A people who make me angry every day, making offerings in gardens, and burning perfumes on bricks.
Who are seated in the resting-places of the dead, and by night are in the secret places; who take pig's flesh for food, and have the liquid of disgusting things in their vessels.
Who say, Keep away, do not come near me, for fear that I make you holy: these are a smoke in my nose, a fire burning all day.
See, it is recorded before me, says the Lord: I will not keep back my hand, till I have sent punishment,
For their sins and the sins of their fathers, who were burning perfumes on the mountains, and saying evil things against me on the hills: so I will take the measure of their sins, and will send the punishment for them into their breast.
This is the word of the Lord : As the new wine is seen in the grapes , and they say , Do not send destruction on it , for a blessing is in it : so will I do for my servants , in order that I may not
put an end to them all .
And I will take a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah one who will have my mountains for a heritage: and the people I have taken to be mine will have it for themselves, and my servants will have their resting-place there.
And Sharon will be a grass-land for the flocks, and the valley of Achor a resting-place for the herds: for my people whose hearts have been turned back to me.
But as for you who have given up the Lord, who have no care for my holy mountain, who get ready a table for Chance, and make offerings of mixed wine to Fate;
Your fate will be the sword , and you will all go down to death : because when my voice came to you , you made no answer ; you did not give ear to my word ; but you did what was evil in my eyes , desiring what
was not pleasing to me .
For this cause says the Lord God, My servants will have food, but you will be in need of food: my servants will have drink, but you will be dry: my servants will have joy, but you will be shamed:
My servants will make songs in the joy of their hearts, but you will be crying for sorrow, and making sounds of grief from a broken spirit.
And your name will become a curse to my people, and the Lord God will put you to death, and give his servants another name:
So that he who is requesting a blessing will make use of the name of the true God , and he who takes an oath will do so by the true God ; because the past troubles are gone out of mind , and because they are covered from my
eyes .
For see, I am making a new heaven and a new earth: and the past things will be gone completely out of mind.
But men will be glad and have joy for ever in what I am making; for I am making Jerusalem a delight, and her people a joy.
And I will be glad over Jerusalem, and have joy in my people: and the voice of weeping will no longer be sounding in her, or the voice of grief.
No longer will there be there a child whose days are cut short , or an old man whose days have not come to their full measure : for the young man at his death will be a hundred years old , and he whose life is shorter than a
hundred years will seem as one cursed .
And they will be building houses and living in them; planting vine-gardens and getting the fruit of them.
They will no longer be building for the use of others , or planting for others to have the fruit : for the days of my people will be like the days of a tree , and my loved ones will have joy in full measure in the work of
their hands .
Their work will not be for nothing, and they will not give birth to children for destruction; for they are a seed to whom the Lord has given his blessing, and their offspring will be with them.
And before they make their request I will give an answer, and while they are still making prayer to me, I will give ear.
The wolf and the lamb will take their food together , and the lion will make a meal of grass like the ox : but dust will be the snake ' s food . There will be no cause of pain or destruction in all my holy mountain , says
the Lord .
The Lord says, Heaven is the seat of my power, and earth is the resting-place for my feet: what sort of house will you make for me, and what place will be my resting-place?
For all these things my hand has made, and they are mine, says the Lord; but to this man only will I give attention, to him who is poor and broken in spirit, fearing my word.
He who puts an ox to death puts a man to death ; he who makes an offering of a lamb puts a dog to death ; he who makes a meal offering makes an offering of pig ' s blood ; he who makes an offering of perfumes for
a sign gives worship to an image : as they have gone after their desires , and their soul takes pleasure in their disgusting things ;
So I will go after trouble for them , and will send on them what they are fearing : because no one made answer to my voice , or gave ear to my word ; but they did what was evil in my eyes , going after that in which
I took no pleasure .
Give ear to the word of the Lord , you who are in fear at his word : your countrymen , hating you , and driving you out because of my name , have said , Let the Lord ' s glory be made clear , so that we may
see your joy ; but they will be put to shame .
There is a noise of war from the town, a sound from the Temple, the voice of the Lord giving punishment to his haters.
Before her pains came, she gave birth; before her pains, she gave birth to a man-child.
When has such a story come to men ' s ears ? who has seen such things ? will a land come to birth in one day ? will a nation be given birth in a minute ? For when Zion ' s pains came on her , she gave
birth to her children straight away .
Will I by whom the birth was started, not make it complete? says the Lord. Will I who make children come to birth, let them be kept back? says your God.
Have joy with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you her lovers: take part in her joy, all you who are sorrowing for her:
So that you may take of the comfort flowing from her breasts, and be delighted with the full measure of her glory.
For the Lord says, See, I will make her peace like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream, and she will take her children in her arms, gently caring for them on her knees.
As to one who is comforted by his mother, so will I give you comfort: and you will be comforted in Jerusalem.
And you will see it and your heart will be glad, and your bones will get new strength, like young grass: and the hand of the Lord will be seen at work for his servants, and his wrath against his haters.
For the Lord is coming with fire, and his war-carriages will be like the storm-wind; to give punishment in the heat of his wrath, and his passion is like flames of fire.
For with fire and sword will the Lord come, judging all the earth, and his sword will be on all flesh: and great numbers will be put to death by him.
As for those who keep themselves separate , and make themselves clean in the gardens , going after one in the middle , taking pig ' s flesh for food , and other disgusting things , such as the mouse : their works and their thoughts will come to an
end together , says the Lord .
And I am coming to get together all nations and tongues: and they will come and will see my glory.
And I will put a sign among them , and I will send those who are still living to the nations , to Tarshish , Put , and Lud , Meshech and Rosh , Tubal and Javan , to the sea-lands far away , who have not had word of
me , or seen my glory ; and they will give the knowledge of my glory to the nations .
And they will take your countrymen out of all the nations for an offering to the Lord , on horses , and in carriages , and in carts , and on asses , and on camels , to my holy mountain Jerusalem , says the Lord , as the children
of Israel take their offering in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord .
And some of them will I take for priests and Levites, says the Lord.
For as the new heaven and the new earth which I will make will be for ever before me, says the Lord, so will your seed and your name be for ever.
And it will be, that from new moon to new moon, and from Sabbath to Sabbath, all flesh will come to give worship before me, says the Lord.
And they will go out to see the dead bodies of the men who have done evil against me: for their worm will ever be living, and their fire will never be put out, and they will be a thing of fear to all flesh.
Now it came about in the days of Ahaz , the son of Jotham , the son of Uzziah , king of Judah , that Rezin , the king of Aram , and Pekah , the son of Remaliah , the king of Israel , came up to Jerusalem to
make war against it , but were not able to overcome it .
And word came to the family of David that Aram had put up its tents in Ephraim. And the king's heart, and the hearts of his people, were moved, like the trees of the wood shaking in the wind.
Then the Lord said to Isaiah, Go out now, you and Shear-jashub, your son, and you will come across Ahaz at the end of the stream flowing from the higher pool, in the highway of the washerman's field;
And say to him, Take care and be quiet; have no fear, and do not let your heart be feeble, because of these two ends of smoking fire-wood, because of the bitter wrath of Rezin and Aram, and of the son of Remaliah.
Because Aram has made evil designs against you, saying,
Let us go up against Judah, troubling her, and forcing our way into her, and let us put up a king in her, even the son of Tabeel:
This is the word of the Lord God: This design will not come about or be effected.
For the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin (and in sixty-five years from now Ephraim will be broken, and will no longer be a people):
And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If you will not have faith, your kingdom will be broken.
And Isaiah said again to Ahaz,
Make a request to the Lord your God for a sign, a sign in the deep places of the underworld, or in the high heavens.
But Ahaz said, I will not put the Lord to the test by making such a request.
And he said, Give ear now, O family of David: is it not enough that you are driving men to disgust? will you do the same to my God?
For this cause the Lord himself will give you a sign; a young woman is now with child, and she will give birth to a son, and she will give him the name Immanuel.
Butter and honey will be his food, when he is old enough to make a decision between evil and good.
For before the child is old enough to make a decision between evil and good, the land whose two kings you are now fearing will have become waste.
The Lord is about to send on you , and on your people , and on your father ' s house , such a time of trouble as there has not been from the days of the separating of Ephraim from Judah ; even the coming of the king of
Assyria .
And it will be in that day that the Lord will make a piping sound for the fly which is in the end of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee which is in the land of Assyria.
And they will come, covering all the waste valleys, and the holes of the rocks, and the thorns, and all the watering-places.
In that day will the Lord take away the hair of the head and of the feet, as well as the hair of the face, with a blade got for a price from the other side of the River; even with the king of Assyria.
And it will be in that day that a man will give food to a young cow and two sheep;
And they will give so much milk that he will be able to have butter for his food: for butter and honey will be the food of all who are still living in the land.
And it will be in that day that in every place where before there were a thousand vines valued at a thousand shekels of silver, there will be nothing but blackberries and thorns.
Men will come there with bows and arrows, because all the land will be full of blackberries and thorns.
And they will send out the oxen and the sheep on all the hills which before were worked with the spade, ... fear of blackberries and thorns.
And the Lord said to me, Take a great writing-board, and on it put down in common letters, Maher-shalal-hash-baz;
And take true witnesses to the writing, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah, the son of Jeberechiah.
And I went in to my wife, and she became with child, and gave birth to a son. Then the Lord said to me, Give him the name Maher-shalal-hash-baz,
For before the child is able to say, Father, or, Mother, the wealth of Damascus and the goods of Samaria will be taken away by the king of Assyria.
And the Lord said again to me,
Because this people will have nothing to do with the softly-flowing waters of Shiloah, and have fear of Rezin and Remaliah's son;
For this cause the Lord is sending on them the waters of the River, deep and strong, even the king of Assyria and all his glory: and it will come up through all its streams, overflowing all its edges:
And it will come on into Judah; rushing on and overflowing, till the waters are up to the neck; *** and his outstretched wings will be covering the land from side to side: for God is with us.
Have knowledge, O peoples, and be in fear; give ear, all you far-off parts of the earth:
Let your designs be formed, and they will come to nothing; give your orders, and they will not be effected: for God is with us.
For the Lord, controlling me with a strong hand, gave me orders not to go in the way of this people, saying,
Do not say, It is holy, about everything of which this people says, It is holy; and do not be in fear of what they go in fear of.
But let the Lord of armies be holy to you, and go in fear of him, giving honour to him.
And he will be for a holy place: but for a stone of falling and a rock of trouble to the two houses of Israel, and to the men of Jerusalem, for a net in which they may be taken.
And numbers of them, falling on the stone, will be broken, and will be taken in the net.
Let my teaching be kept secret: and my words be given to my disciples only.
And I will be waiting for the Lord, whose face is veiled from the house of Jacob, and I will be looking for him.
See, I and the children whom the Lord has given me, are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of armies, whose resting-place is in Mount Zion.
And when they say to you , Make request for us to those who have control of spirits , and to those wise in secret arts , who make hollow bird-like sounds ; is it not right for a people to make request to their gods , to make request
for the living to the dead ?
Then say to them, Put your faith in the teaching and the witness. ... If they do not say such things. ... For him there is no dawn. ...
And he will go through the land in bitter trouble and in need of food; and when he is unable to get food, he will become angry, cursing his king and his God, and his eyes will be turned to heaven on high;
And he will be looking down on the earth, and there will be trouble and dark clouds, black night where there is no seeing.
In earlier times he made the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali of small value, but after that he gave it glory, by the way of the sea, on the other side of Jordan, Galilee of the nations.
The people who went in the dark have seen a great light, and for those who were living in the land of the deepest night, the light is shining.
You have made them very glad, increasing their joy. They are glad before you as men are glad in the time of getting in the grain, or when they make division of the goods taken in war.
For by your hand the yoke on his neck and the rod on his back, even the rod of his cruel master, have been broken, as in the day of Midian.
For every boot of the man of war with his sounding step, and the clothing rolled in blood, will be for burning, food for the fire.
For to us a child has come, to us a son is given; and the government has been placed in his hands; and he has been named Wise Guide, Strong God, Father for ever, Prince of Peace.
Of the increase of his rule and of peace there will be no end , on the seat of David , and in his kingdom ; to make it strong , supporting it with wise decision and righteousness , now and for ever . By the fixed purpose of the
Lord of armies this will be done .
The Lord has sent a word to Jacob, and it has come on Israel;
And all the people will have experience of it, even Ephraim and the men of Samaria, who say in the pride of their uplifted hearts,
The bricks have come down, but we will put up buildings of cut stone in their place: the sycamores are cut down, but they will be changed to cedars.
For this cause the Lord has made strong the haters of Israel, driving them on to make war against him;
Aram on the east, and the Philistines on the west, who have come against Israel with open mouths. For all this his wrath is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
But the heart of the people was not turned to him who sent punishment on them, and they made no prayer to the Lord of armies.
For this cause the Lord took away from Israel head and tail, high and low, in one day.
The man who is honoured and responsible is the head, and the prophet who gives false teaching is the tail.
For the guides of this people are the cause of their wandering from the right way, and those who are guided by them come to destruction.
For this cause the Lord will have no pleasure in their young men , and no pity on their widows and the children without fathers : for they are all haters of God and evil-doers , and foolish words come from every mouth . For all this his wrath is
not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
For evil was burning like a fire; the blackberries and thorns were burned up; the thick woods took fire, rolling up in dark clouds of smoke.
The land was dark with the wrath of the Lord of armies: the people were like those who take men's flesh for food.
On the right a man was cutting off bits and was still in need; on the left a man took a meal but had not enough; no man had pity on his brother; every man was making a meal of the flesh of his neighbour.
Manasseh was making a meal of Ephraim, and Ephraim of Manasseh; and together they were attacking Judah. For all this his wrath is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
To whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his rule.
And it came again in the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, up to the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah; till Jerusalem was taken away in the fifth month.
Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
Before you were formed in the body of your mother I had knowledge of you, and before your birth I made you holy; I have given you the work of being a prophet to the nations.
Then said I, O Lord God! see, I have no power of words, for I am a child.
But the Lord said to me, Do not say, I am a child: for wherever I send you, you are to go, and whatever I give you orders to say, you are to say.
Have no fear because of them: for I am with you, to keep you safe, says the Lord.
Then the Lord put out his hand, touching my mouth; and the Lord said to me, See, I have put my words in your mouth:
See, this day I have put you over the nations and over the kingdoms, for uprooting and smashing down, for destruction and overturning, for building up and planting.
Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what do you see? And I said, I see a branch of an almond-tree.
Then the Lord said to me, You have seen well: for I keep watch over my word to give effect to it.
And the word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying, What do you see? And I said, I see a boiling pot, and its face is from the north.
Then the Lord said to me, Out of the north evil will come, bursting out on all the people of the land.
For see , I will send for all the families of the kingdoms of the north , says the Lord ; and they will come , everyone placing his high seat at the way into Jerusalem , and against its walls on every side , and against all the towns
of Judah .
And I will give my decision against them on account of all their evil-doing; because they have given me up, burning perfumes to other gods and worshipping the works of their hands.
So make yourself ready, and go and say to them everything I give you orders to say: do not be overcome by fear of them, or I will send fear on you before them.
For see, this day have I made you a walled town, and an iron pillar, and walls of brass, against all the land, against the kings of Judah, against its captains, against its priests, and against the people of the land.
They will be fighting against you, but they will not overcome you: for I am with you, says the Lord, to give you salvation.
Give ear to the word which the Lord says to you, O people of Israel:
This is what the Lord has said: Do not go in the way of the nations; have no fear of the signs of heaven, for the nations go in fear of them.
For that which is feared by the people is foolish: it is the work of the hands of the workman; for a tree is cut down by him out of the woods with his axe.
They make it beautiful with silver and gold; they make it strong with nails and hammers, so that it may not be moved.
It is like a pillar in a garden of plants , and has no voice : it has to be lifted , for it has no power of walking . Have no fear of it ; for it has no power of doing evil and it is not able to
do any good .
There is no one like you, O Lord; you are great and your name is great in power.
Who would not have fear of you, O King of the nations? for it is your right: for among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is no one like you.
But they are together like beasts and foolish: the teaching of false gods is wood.
Silver hammered into plates is sent from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the expert workman and of the hands of the gold-worker; blue and purple is their clothing, all the work of expert men.
But the Lord is the true God; he is the living God and an eternal king: when he is angry, the earth is shaking with fear, and the nations give way before his wrath.
This is what you are to say to them: The gods who have not made the heavens and the earth will be cut off from the earth and from under the heavens.
He has made the earth by his power, he has made the world strong in its place by his wisdom, and by his wise design the heavens have been stretched out.
At the sound of his voice there is a massing of waters in the heavens, and he makes the mists go up from the ends of the earth; he makes the thunder-flames for the rain, and sends out the wind from his store-houses.
Then every man becomes like a beast without knowledge; every gold-worker is put to shame by the image he has made: for his metal image is deceit, and there is no breath in them.
They are nothing, a work of error: in the time of their punishment, destruction will overtake them.
The heritage of Jacob is not like these; for the maker of all things is his heritage: the Lord of armies is his name.
Get your goods together and go out of the land, O you who are shut up in the walled town.
For the Lord has said, I will send the people in flight like a stone from the land at this time, troubling them so that they will be conscious of it.
Sorrow is mine for I am wounded! my wound may not be made well; and I said, Cruel is my disease, I may not be free from it.
My tent is pulled down and all my cords are broken: my children have gone from me, and they are not: no longer is there anyone to give help in stretching out my tent and hanging up my curtains.
For the keepers of the sheep have become like beasts, not looking to the Lord for directions: so they have not done wisely and all their flocks have been put to flight.
News is going about, see, it is coming, a great shaking is coming from the north country, so that the towns of Judah may be made waste and become the living-place of jackals.
O Lord, I am conscious that a man's way is not in himself: man has no power of guiding his steps.
O Lord, put me right, but with wise purpose; not in your wrath, or you will make me small.
Let your wrath be let loose on the nations which have no knowledge of you , and on the families who give no worship to your name : for they have made a meal of Jacob , truly they have made a meal of him and put an end to
him and made his fields a waste .
The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,
Give ear to the words of this agreement, and say to the men of Judah and to the people of Jerusalem,
The Lord, the God of Israel, has said, Let that man be cursed who does not give ear to the words of this agreement,
To the order which I gave your fathers on the day when I took them out of the land of Egypt , out of the oven of iron , saying , Give ear to my voice , and do all the orders I have given you : so you will
be my people , and I will be your God :
So that I may give effect to the oath which I made to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey as at this day. And I said in answer, So be it, O Lord.
And the Lord said to me, Give out these words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Give ear to the words of this agreement and do them.
For I gave certain witness to your fathers on the day when I took them up out of the land of Egypt, and even to this day, getting up early and witnessing and saying, Give ear to my voice.
But they gave no attention and did not give ear , but they went on , every man in the pride of his evil heart : so I sent on them all the curses in this agreement , which I gave them orders to keep , but they did not
And the Lord said to me, There is an evil design at work among the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem.
They are turned back to the sins of their fathers , who would not give ear to my words ; they have gone after other gods and become their servants : the people of Israel and the people of Judah have not kept the agreement which I made with their
fathers .
So the Lord has said, I will send evil on them, which they will not be able to get away from; and they will send up a cry for help to me, but I will not give ear to them.
Then the towns of Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go crying for help to the gods to whom they have been burning perfumes: but they will give them no salvation in the time of their trouble.
For the number of your gods is as the number of your towns, O Judah; and for every street in Jerusalem you have put up altars to the Baal for burning perfumes to the Baal.
And as for you, make no prayers for this people, send up no cry or prayer for them: for I will not give ear to their cry in the time of their trouble.
About Judah. What have you to do in my house? is it your thought that oaths and holy flesh will get you out of your trouble? will you make yourself safe in this way?
You had been named by the Lord, A branching olive-tree, fair with beautiful fruit: with the noise of a great rushing he has put it on fire and its branches are broken.
For the Lord of armies, by whom you were planted, has given his decision for evil against you, because of the evil which the people of Israel and the people of Judah have done, In moving me to wrath by offering perfumes to the Baal.
And the Lord gave me knowledge of it and I saw it: then you made clear to me their doings.
But I was like a gentle lamb taken to be put to death ; I had no thought that they were designing evil against me , saying , Come and let us make trouble his food , cutting him off from the land of the living , so that there
may be no more memory of his name .
But, O Lord of armies, judging in righteousness, testing the thoughts and the heart, let me see your punishment come on them: for I have put my cause before you.
So this is what the Lord of armies has said about the men of Anathoth who have made designs against your life, saying, You are not to be a prophet in the name of the Lord, or death will overtake you by our hands:
So the Lord of armies has said, See, I will send punishment on them: the young men will be put to the sword; their sons and their daughters will come to death through need of food:
Not one of them will keep his life, for I will send evil on the men of Anathoth in the year of their punishment.
You are in the right, O Lord, when I put my cause before you: still let me take up with you the question of your decisions: why does the evil-doer do well? why are the workers of deceit living in comfort?
They have been planted by you, they have taken root; they go on and give fruit: you are near in their mouths but far from their thoughts.
But you, O Lord, have knowledge of me; you see me, searching and testing how my heart is with you: let them be pulled out like sheep to be put to death, make them ready for the day of death.
How long will the land have grief, and the plants of all the land be dry? because of the sins of the people living in it, destruction has overtaken the beasts and the birds; because they said, God does not see our ways.
If running with the fighting-men has made you tired, how will you be able to keep up with horses? and if in a land of peace you go in flight, what will become of you in the thick growth of Jordan?
For even your brothers, your father's family, even they have been untrue to you, crying loudly after you: have no faith in them, though they say fair words to you.
I have given up my house, I have let my heritage go; I have given the loved one of my soul into the hands of her haters.
My heritage has become like a lion in the woodland to me; her voice has been loud against me; so I have hate for her.
My heritage is like a brightly coloured bird to me; the cruel birds are attacking her on every side: go, get together all the beasts of the field, make them come for destruction.
The keepers of sheep have been the destruction of my vine-garden, crushing my heritage under their feet; they have made my fair heritage an unplanted waste;
They have made it waste; it is weeping to me, being wasted; all the land is made waste, because no man takes it to heart.
Those who make waste have come on all the open hilltops in the waste land; for the sword of the Lord sends destruction from one end of the land to the other end of the land: no flesh has peace.
Though good grain was planted, they have got in thorns: they have given themselves pain without profit: they will be shamed on account of their produce, because of the burning wrath of the Lord.
This is what the Lord has said against all my evil neighbours, who put their hands on the heritage which I gave my people Israel: See, I will have them uprooted from their land, uprooting the people of Judah from among them.
And it will come about that, after they have been uprooted, I will again have pity on them; and I will take them back, every man to his heritage and every man to his land.
And it will be that , if they give their minds to learning the ways of my people , using my name in their oaths , By the living Lord ; as they have been teaching my people to take oaths by the Baal ; then their place will be
made certain among my people .
But if they will not give ear, then I will have that nation uprooted, and given to destruction, says the Lord.
This is what the Lord said to me: Go and get yourself a linen band and put it round you and do not put it in water.
So, as the Lord said, I got a band for a price and put it round my body.
And the word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying,
Take the band which you got for a price, which is round your body, and go to Parah and put it in a secret place there in a hole of the rock.
So I went and put it in a secret place by Parah, as the Lord had said to me.
Then after a long time, the Lord said to me, Up! go to Parah and get the band which I gave you orders to put there.
So I went to Parah and, uncovering the hole, took the band from the place where I had put it away: and the band was damaged and of no use for anything.
Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
The Lord has said, In this way I will do damage to the pride of Judah and to the great pride of Jerusalem.
These evil people who say they will not give ear to my words, who go on in the pride of their hearts and have become servants and worshippers of other gods, will become like this band which is of no use for anything.
For as a band goes tightly round a man ' s body , so I made all the people of Israel and all the people of Judah tightly united to me ; so that they might be a people for me and a name and a praise and a glory
: but they would not give ear .
So you are to say this word to them : This is the word of the Lord , the God of Israel : Every skin bottle will be full of wine ; and they will say to you , Is it not quite clear to us that every skin bottle
will be full of wine ?
Then you are to say to them , The Lord has said , I will make all the people of this land , even the kings seated on David ' s seat , and the priests and the prophets and all the people of Jerusalem , overcome with strong drink
I will have them smashed against one another, fathers and sons together, says the Lord: I will have no pity or mercy, I will have no feeling for them to keep me from giving them to destruction.
Give ear and let your ears be open; be not lifted up: for these are the words of the Lord.
Give glory to the Lord your God, before he makes it dark, and before your feet are slipping on the dark mountains, and, while you are looking for a light, he makes it into deep dark, into black night.
But if you do not give ear to it, my soul will be weeping in secret for your pride; my eye will be weeping bitterly, streaming with water, because the Lord's flock has been taken away as prisoners.
Say to the king and to the queen-mother, Make yourselves low, be seated on the earth: for the crown of your glory has come down from your heads.
The towns of the south are shut up, and there is no one to make them open: Judah is taken away as prisoners; all Judah is taken away as prisoners.
Let your eyes be lifted up (O Jerusalem), and see those who are coming from the north. Where is the flock which was given to you, your beautiful flock?
What will you say when he puts over you those whom you yourself have made your friends? will not pains take you like a woman in childbirth?
And if you say in your heart, Why have these things come on me? because of the number of your sins, your skirts have been uncovered and violent punishment overtakes you.
Is it possible for the skin of the Ethiopian to be changed, or the markings on the leopard? Then it might be possible for you to do good, who have been trained to do evil.
So I will send them in all directions, as dry grass is taken away by the wind of the waste land.
This is your fate, the part measured out to you by me, says the Lord, because you have put me out of your memory and put your faith in what is false.
So I will have your skirts uncovered before your face, in order that your shame may be seen.
I have seen your disgusting acts , even your false behaviour and your cries of desire and your loose ways on the hills in the field . Unhappy are you , O Jerusalem , you have no desire to be made clean ; how long will you be in turning
back to me ?
The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah when there was no water.
Judah is weeping and its doors are dark with sorrow, and people are seated on the earth clothed in black; and the cry of Jerusalem has gone up.
Their great men have sent their servants for water: they come to the holes and there is no water to be seen; they come back with nothing in their vessels; they are overcome with shame and fear, covering their heads.
Those who do work on the land are in fear, for there has been no rain on the land, and the farmers are shamed, covering their heads.
And the roe, giving birth in the field, lets her young one be uncared for, because there is no grass.
And the asses of the field on the open hilltops are opening their mouths wide like jackals to get air; their eyes are hollow because there is no grass.
Though our sins give witness against us, do something, O Lord, for the honour of your name: for again and again we have been turned away from you, we have done evil against you.
O you hope of Israel, its saviour in time of trouble, why are you like one who is strange in the land, and like a traveller putting up his tent for a night?
Why are you like a man surprised, like a man of war who is not able to give help? but you, O Lord, are with us, and we are named by your name; do not go away from us.
This is what the Lord has said about this people : Even so they have been glad to go from the right way ; they have not kept their feet from wandering , so the Lord has no pleasure in them ; now he will keep their wrongdoing in mind
and send punishment for their sins .
And the Lord said to me, Make no prayer for this people for their good.
When they go without food , I will not give ear to their cry ; when they give burned offerings and meal offerings , I will not take pleasure in them : but I will put an end to them by the sword and by need of food and by
disease .
Then I said, Ah, Lord God! see, the prophets say to them, You will not see the sword or be short of food; but I will give you certain peace in this place.
Then the Lord said to me , The prophets say false words in my name , and I gave them no orders , and I said nothing to them : what they say to you is a false vision and wonder-working words without substance , the deceit of their hearts
So this is what the Lord has said about the prophets who make use of my name , though I sent them not , and say , The sword and need of food will not be in this land : the sword and need of food will put an end
to those prophets .
And the people to whom they are prophets will be pushed out dead into the streets of Jerusalem , because there is no food , and because of the sword ; and they will have no one to put their bodies into the earth , them or their wives or
their sons or their daughters : for I will let loose their evil-doing on them .
And you are to say this word to them, Let my eyes be streaming with water night and day, and let it not be stopped; for the virgin daughter of my people is wounded with a great wound, with a very bitter blow.
If I go out into the open country , there are those put to death by the sword ! and if I go into the town , there are those who are diseased from need of food ! for the prophet and the priest go about in the land and
have no knowledge .
Have you completely given up Judah ? is your soul turned in disgust from Zion ? why have you given us blows from which there is no one to make us well ? we were looking for peace , but no good came ; and for a time of well-being
, but there was only a great fear .
We are conscious, O Lord, of our sin and of the wrongdoing of our fathers: we have done evil against you.
Do not be turned from us in disgust, because of your name; do not put shame on the seat of your glory: keep us in mind, let not your agreement with us be broken.
Are any of the false gods of the nations able to make rain come? are the heavens able to give showers? are you not he, O Lord our God? so we will go on waiting for you, for you have done all these things.
Then the Lord said to me, Even if Moses and Samuel came before me, I would have no desire for this people: send them away from before me, and let them go.
And it will be , when they say to you , Where are we to go ? then you are to say to them , The Lord has said , Such as are for death , to death ; and such as are for the sword , to the sword
; and such as are to be in need of food , to need of food ; and such as are to be taken away prisoners , to be taken away .
And I will put over them four divisions, says the Lord: the sword causing death, dogs pulling the dead bodies about, and the birds of heaven, and the beasts of the earth to take their bodies for food and put an end to them.
And I will make them a cause of fear to all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, and what he did in Jerusalem.
For who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem? and who will have sorrow for you? or who will go out of his way to see how you are?
You have given me up, says the Lord, you have gone back: so my hand is stretched out against you for your destruction; I am tired of changing my purpose.
And I have sent a cleaning wind on them in the public places of the land; I have taken their children from them; I have given my people to destruction; they have not been turned from their ways.
I have let their widows be increased in number more than the sand of the seas : I have sent against them , against the mother and the young men , one who makes waste in the heat of the day , causing pain and fears to come on her
suddenly .
The mother of seven is without strength ; her spirit is gone from her , her sun has gone down while it is still day : she has been shamed and overcome : and the rest of them I will give up to the sword before their haters , says
the Lord .
Sorrow is mine , my mother , because you have given birth to me , a cause of fighting and argument in all the earth ! I have not made men my creditors and I am not in debt to any , but every one of them is cursing me
...
Is it possible for iron to be broken; even iron from the north, and brass?
I will give your wealth and your stores to your attackers, without a price, because of all your sins, even in every part of your land.
They will go away with your haters into a land which is strange to you: for my wrath is on fire with a flame which will be burning on you.
O Lord , you have knowledge : keep me in mind and come to my help , and give their right reward to those who are attacking me ; take me not away , for you are slow to be angry : see how I have undergone shame because of
you from all those who make little of your word ;
But to me your word is a joy, making my heart glad; for I am named by your name, O Lord God of armies.
I did not take my seat among the band of those who are glad, and I had no joy; I kept by myself because of your hand; for you have made me full of wrath.
Why is my pain unending and my wound without hope of being made well? Sorrow is mine, for you are to me as a stream offering false hope and as waters which are not certain.
For this cause the Lord has said , If you will come back , then I will again let you take your place before me ; and if you give out what is of value and not that which has no value , you will be as my mouth :
let them come back to you , but do not go back to them .
And I will make you a strong wall of brass to this people; they will be fighting against you, but they will not overcome you: for I am with you to keep you safe, says the Lord.
I will keep you safe from the hands of the evil-doers, and I will give you salvation from the hands of the cruel ones.
Then again the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
You are not to take a wife for yourself or have sons or daughters in this place.
For this is what the Lord has said about the sons and daughters who come to birth in this place, and about their mothers who have given them birth, and about their fathers who have given life to them in this land:
Death from evil diseases will overtake them ; there will be no weeping for them and their bodies will not be put to rest ; they will be like waste on the face of the earth : the sword and need of food will put an end to them ;
their dead bodies will be meat for the birds of heaven and for the beasts of the earth .
For this is what the Lord has said : Do not go into the house of sorrow , do not go to make weeping or songs of grief for them : for I have taken away my peace from this people , says the Lord , even mercy and pity
Death will overtake great as well as small in the land: their bodies will not be put in a resting-place, and no one will be weeping for them or wounding themselves or cutting off their hair for them:
No one will make a feast for them in sorrow, to give them comfort for the dead, or put to their lips the cup of comfort on account of their father or their mother.
And you are not to go into the house of feasting, or be seated with them to take food or drink.
For the Lord of armies , the God of Israel , has said , See , before your eyes and in your days I will put an end in this place to the laughing voices and the voice of joy ; to the voice of the newly-married man and the
voice of the bride .
And it will be , that when you say all these words to the people , then they will say to you , Why has the Lord done all this evil against us ? what is our wrongdoing and what is our sin which we have done against the Lord
our God ?
Then you will say to them, Because your fathers have given me up, says the Lord, and have gone after other gods and become their servants and their worshippers, and have given me up and have not kept my law;
And you have done worse evil than your fathers; for see, every one of you is guided by the pride of his evil heart, so as not to give ear to me:
For this reason I will send you away out of this land into a land which is strange to you, to you and to your fathers; there you will be the servants of other gods day and night, and you will have no mercy from me.
For this cause, see, the days are coming, says the Lord, when it will no longer be said, By the living Lord, who took the children of Israel up out of the land of Egypt.
But, By the living Lord, who took the children of Israel up out of the land of the north, and from all the countries where he had sent them: and I will take them back again to their land which I gave to their fathers.
See , I will send for great numbers of fishermen , says the Lord , and they will take them like fish in a net ; and after that , I will send for numbers of bowmen , and they will go after them , driving them from every mountain
and from every hill , and out of the holes of the rocks .
For my eyes are on all their ways: there is no cover for them from my face, and their evil-doing is not kept secret from my eyes.
And I will give them the reward of their evil-doing and their sin twice over; because they have made my land unclean, and have made my heritage full of the bodies of their unholy and disgusting things.
O Lord , my strength and my strong tower , my safe place in the day of trouble , the nations will come to you from the ends of the earth , and say , The heritage of our fathers is nothing but deceit , even false things in which
there is no profit .
Will a man make for himself gods which are no gods?
For this reason, truly, I will make them see, this once I will give them knowledge of my hand and my power; and they will be certain that my name is the Lord.
The sin of Judah is recorded with a pen of iron, and with the sharp point of a jewel it is cut on their hearts of stone, and on the horns of their altars for a sign to them:
Their altars and their wood pillars under every branching tree, on the high hills and the mountains in the field.
I will give your wealth and all your stores to be taken away in war without a price, because of your sins in every part of your land.
And your hand will have to let go your heritage which I gave you ; and I will make you a servant to your haters in a land which is strange to you : for you have put my wrath on fire with a flame which will go on burning
for ever .
This is what the Lord has said: Cursed is the man who puts his faith in man, and makes flesh his arm, and whose heart is turned away from the Lord.
For he will be like the brushwood in the upland, and will not see when good comes; but his living-place will be in the dry places in the waste land, in a salt and unpeopled land.
A blessing is on the man who puts his faith in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is.
For he will be like a tree planted by the waters , pushing out its roots by the stream ; he will have no fear when the heat comes , but his leaf will be green ; in a dry year he will have no care , and will go
on giving fruit .
The heart is a twisted thing, not to be searched out by man: who is able to have knowledge of it?
I the Lord am the searcher of the heart, the tester of the thoughts, so that I may give to every man the reward of his ways, in keeping with the fruit of his doings.
Like the partridge, getting eggs together but not producing young, is a man who gets wealth but not by right; before half his days are ended, it will go from him, and at his end he will be foolish.
A seat of glory, placed on high from the first, is our holy place.
O Lord, the hope of Israel, all who give you up will be put to shame; those who go away from you will be cut off from the earth, because they have given up the Lord, the fountain of living waters.
Make me well, O Lord, and I will be well; be my saviour, and I will be safe: for you are my hope.
See, they say to me, Where is the word of the Lord? let it come now.
As for me, I have not said; Let the day of trouble come to them quickly; and I have not been hoping for the death-giving day; you have knowledge of what came from my lips; it was open before you.
Be not a cause of fear to me: you are my safe place in the day of evil.
Let them be put to shame who are attacking me, but let me not be shamed; let them be overcome with fear, but let me not be overcome: send on them the day of evil, and put them to destruction twice over.
This is what the Lord has said to me: Go and take your place in the doorway of Benjamin, where the kings of Judah come in and by which they go out, and in all the doorways of Jerusalem;
And say to them, Give ear to the word of the Lord, you kings of Judah, and all the people of Jerusalem who come in by these doors:
This is what the Lord has said: See to yourselves, that you take up no weight on the Sabbath day, or take it in through the doors of Jerusalem;
And take no weight out of your houses on the Sabbath day, or do any work, but keep the Sabbath day holy, as I gave orders to your fathers;
But they gave no attention and would not give ear, but they made their necks stiff so that they might not give ear and might not get teaching.
And it will be, that if with all care you give ear to me, says the Lord, and take no weight through the doorways of this town on the Sabbath day, but keep the Sabbath day holy and do no work in it;
Then through the doors of this town there will come kings and princes , seated on the seat of David , going in carriages and on horseback , they and their princes , and the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem : and this town will keep its
place for ever .
And they will come from the towns of Judah , and from the places round about Jerusalem , and from the land of Benjamin , and from the lowlands , and from the mountains , and from the South , with burned offerings and offerings of beasts and meal offerings
and perfume and offerings of praise , to the house of the Lord .
But if you do not give ear to me , to keep the Sabbath day holy , and to let no weight be lifted and taken through the doors of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day : then I will put a fire in its doorways , burning up the great
houses of Jerusalem , and it will never be put out .
The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,
Up! go down to the potter's house, and there I will let my words come to your ears.
Then I went down to the potter's house, and he was doing his work on the stones.
And when the vessel, which he was forming out of earth, got damaged in the hand of the potter, he made it again into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make it.
Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
O Israel, am I not able to do with you as this potter does? says the Lord. See, like earth in the potter's hand are you in my hands, O Israel.
Whenever I say anything about uprooting a nation or a kingdom, and smashing it and sending destruction on it;
If, in that very minute, that nation of which I was talking is turned away from its evil, my purpose of doing evil to them will be changed.
And whenever I say anything about building up a nation or a kingdom, and planting it;
If, in that very minute, it does evil in my eyes, going against my orders, then my good purpose, which I said I would do for them, will be changed.
Now , then , say to the men of Judah and to the people of Jerusalem , This is what the Lord has said : See , I am forming an evil thing against you , and designing a design against you : let every man come back now from
his evil way , and let your ways and your doings be changed for the better .
But they will say, There is no hope: we will go on in our designs, and every one of us will do what he is moved by the pride of his evil heart to do.
So this is what the Lord has said: Make search among the nations and see who has had word of such things; the virgin of Israel has done a very shocking thing.
Will the white snow go away from the top of Sirion? will the cold waters flowing from the mountains become dry?
For my people have put me out of their memory , burning perfumes to that which is nothing ; and because of this , I will put a cause of falling in their ways , even in the old roads , and will make them go on side-roads , in
a way not lifted up ;
Making their land a thing of wonder, causing sounds of surprise for ever; everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder, shaking his head.
I will send them in flight, as from an east wind, before the attacker; I will let them see my back and not my face on the day of their downfall.
Then they said , Come , let us make a design against Jeremiah ; for teaching will never be cut off from the priest , or wisdom from the wise , or the word from the prophet . Come , let us make use of his words for an attack
on him , and let us give attention with care to what he says .
Give thought to me, O Lord, and give ear to the voice of those who put forward a cause against me.
Is evil to be the reward of good? for they have made a deep hole for my soul. Keep in mind how I took my place before you, to say a good word for them so that your wrath might be turned away from them.
For this cause , let their children be without food , and give them over to the power of the sword ; and let their wives be without children and become widows ; let their men be overtaken by death , and their young men be put to the sword
in the fight .
Let a cry for help go up from their houses, when you send an armed band on them suddenly: for they have made a hole in which to take me, and have put nets for my feet secretly.
But you , Lord , have knowledge of all the designs which they have made against my life ; let not their evil-doing be covered or their sin be washed away from before your eyes : but let it be a cause of falling before you : so do to
them in the time of your wrath .
This is what the Lord has said: Go and get for money a potter's bottle made of earth, and take with you some of the responsible men of the people and of the priests;
And go out to the valley of the son of Hinnom, by the way into the door of broken pots, and there say in a loud voice the words which I will give you;
Say , Give ear to the word of the Lord , O kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem ; the Lord of armies , the God of Israel , has said , See , I will send evil on this place which will be bitter to the ears of
anyone hearing of it .
Because they have given me up , and made this place a strange place , burning perfumes in it to other gods , of whom they and their fathers and the kings of Judah had no knowledge ; and they have made this place full of the blood of those
who have done no wrong ;
And they have put up the high places of the Baal, burning their sons in the fire; a thing which was not ordered by me, and it was never in my mind:
For this cause, see, a time is coming, says the Lord, when this place will no longer be named Topheth, or, The valley of the son of Hinnom, but, The valley of Death.
I will make the purpose of Judah and Jerusalem come to nothing in this place ; I will have them put to the sword by their haters , and by the hands of those who have designs on their life ; and their dead bodies I will give to be
food for the birds of heaven and the beasts of the earth .
And I will make this town a thing of wonder and a cause of surprise; everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder and make sounds of surprise, because of all its troubles.
I will make them take the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters for food , they will be making a meal of one another , because of their bitter need and the cruel grip of their haters and those who have made designs against their life
Then let the potter's bottle be broken before the eyes of the men who have gone with you,
And say to them , This is what the Lord of armies has said : Even so will this people and this town be broken by me , as a potter ' s bottle is broken and may not be put together again : and the bodies of the dead
will be put in the earth in Topheth , till there is no more room .
This is what I will do to this place, says the Lord, and to its people, making this town like Topheth:
And the houses of Jerusalem , and the houses of the kings of Judah , which they have made unclean , will be like the place of Topheth , even all the houses on whose roofs perfumes have been burned to all the army of heaven , and drink offerings
drained out to other gods .
Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where the Lord had sent him to give the prophet's word; and he took his place in the open square of the Lord's house, and said to all the people,
The Lord of armies , the God of Israel , has said : See , I will send on this town and on all her towns all the evil which I have said ; because they made their necks stiff , so that they might not give ear to my
words .
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
Go and say in the ears of Jerusalem , The Lord says , I still keep the memory of your kind heart when you were young , and your love when you became my bride ; how you went after me in the waste of sand , in an unplanted
land .
Israel was holy to the Lord, the first-fruits of his increase: all who made attacks on him were judged as wrongdoers, evil came on them, says the Lord.
Give ear to the words of the Lord, O sons of Jacob and all the families of Israel:
These are the words of the Lord: What evil have your fathers seen in me that they have gone far from me, and, walking after what is false, have become false?
And they never said , Where is the Lord , who took us up out of the land of Egypt ; who was our guide through the waste of sand , through an unplanted land full of deep holes , through a dry land of deep shade , which no
one went through and where no man was living ?
And I took you into a fertile land, where you were living on its fruit and its wealth; but when you came in, you made my land unclean, and made my heritage a disgusting thing.
The priests did not say, Where is the Lord? and those who were expert in the law had no knowledge of me: and the rulers did evil against me, and the prophets became prophets of the Baal, going after things without value.
For this reason, I will again put forward my cause against you, says the Lord, even against you and against your children's children.
For go over to the sea-lands of Kittim and see; send to Kedar and give deep thought to it; and see if there has ever been such a thing.
Has any nation ever made a change in their gods, though they are no gods? but my people have given up their glory in exchange for what is of no profit.
Be full of wonder, O heavens, at this; be overcome with fear, be completely waste, says the Lord.
For my people have done two evils; they have given up me, the fountain of living waters, and have made for themselves water-holes, cut out from the rock, broken water-holes, of no use for storing water.
Is Israel a servant? has he been a house-servant from birth? why has he been made waste?
The young lions have made an outcry against him with a loud voice: they have made his land waste; his towns are burned up, with no one living in them.
Even the children of Noph and Tahpanhes have put shame on you.
Has not this come on you because you have given up the Lord your God, who was your guide by the way?
And now, what have you to do on the way to Egypt, to get your drink from the waters of the Nile? or what have you to do on the way to Assyria, to get your drink from the waters of the River?
The evil you yourselves have done will be your punishment , your errors will be your judge : be certain then , and see that it is an evil and a bitter thing to give up the Lord your God , and no longer to be moved by fear of
me , says the Lord , the Lord of armies .
For in the past, your yoke was broken by your hands and your cords parted; and you said, I will not be your servant; for on every high hill and under every branching tree, your behaviour was like that of a loose woman
But when you were planted by me, you were a noble vine, in every way a true seed: how then have you been changed into the branching plant of a strange vine?
For even if you are washed with soda and take much soap, still your evil-doing is marked before me, says the Lord God.
How are you able to say, I am not unclean, I have not gone after the Baals? see your way in the valley, be clear about what you have done: you are a quick-footed camel twisting her way in and out;
An untrained ass , used to the waste land , breathing up the wind in her desire ; at her time , who is able to send her away ? all those who are looking for her will have no need to make themselves tired ; in her month they
will get her .
Do not let your foot be without shoes, or your throat dry from need of water: but you said, There is no hope: no, for I have been a lover of strange gods, and after them I will go.
As the thief is shamed when he is taken, so is Israel shamed; they, their kings and their rulers, their priests and their prophets;
Who say to a tree , You are my father ; and to a stone , You have given me life : for their backs have been turned to me , not their faces : but in the time of their trouble they will say , Up ! and be
our saviour .
But where are the gods you have made for yourselves? let them come, if they are able to give you salvation in the time of your trouble: for the number of your gods is as the number of your towns, O Judah.
Why will you put forward your cause against me? You have all done evil against me, says the Lord.
I gave your children blows to no purpose; they got no good from training: your sword has been the destruction of your prophets, like a death-giving lion.
O generation, see the word of the Lord. Have I been a waste land to Israel? or a land of dark night? why do my people say, We have got loose, we will not come to you again?
Is it possible for a virgin to put out of her memory her ornaments, or a bride her robes? but my people have put me out of their memories for unnumbered days.
With what care are your ways ordered when you are looking for love! so ... your ways.
And in the skirts of your robe may be seen the life-blood of those who have done no wrong: ...
And still you said, I have done no wrong; truly, his wrath is turned away from me. See, I will take up the cause against you, because you say, I have done no wrong.
Why do you go about so much for the purpose of changing your way? you will be shamed on account of Egypt, as you were shamed on account of Assyria.
Truly, you will go out from him with your hands on your head: for the Lord has given up those in whom you have put your faith, and they will be of no help to you.
Now it came to the ears of Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief in authority in the house of the Lord, that Jeremiah was saying these things;
And Pashhur gave blows to Jeremiah and had his feet chained in a framework of wood in the higher doorway of Benjamin, which was in the house of the Lord.
Then on the day after, Pashhur let Jeremiah loose. Then Jeremiah said to him, The Lord has given you the name of Magor-missabib (Cause-of-fear-on-every-side), not Pashhur.
For the Lord has said , See , I will make you a cause of fear to yourself and to all your friends : they will come to their death by the sword of their haters , and your eyes will see it : and I will give all Judah
into the hands of the king of Babylon , and he will take them away prisoners into Babylon and put them to the sword .
And more than this , I will give all the wealth of this town and all its profits and all its things of value , even all the stores of the kings of Judah will I give into the hands of their haters , who will put violent hands on
them and take them away to Babylon .
And you, Pashhur, and all who are in your house, will go away prisoners: you will come to Babylon, and there your body will be put to rest, you and all your friends, to whom you said false words.
O Lord, you have been false to me, and I was tricked; you are stronger than I, and have overcome me: I have become a thing to be laughed at all the day, everyone makes sport of me.
For every word I say is a cry for help; I say with a loud voice, Violent behaviour and wasting: because the word of the Lord is made a shame to me and a cause of laughing all the day.
And if I say , I will not keep him in mind , I will not say another word in his name ; then it is in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my bones , and I am tired of keeping myself in , I am
not able to do it .
For numbers of them say evil secretly in my hearing ( there is fear on every side ) : they say , Come , let us give witness against him ; all my nearest friends , who are watching for my fall , say , It may be that he
will be taken by deceit , and we will get the better of him and give him punishment .
But the Lord is with me as a great one , greatly to be feared : so my attackers will have a fall , and they will not overcome me : they will be greatly shamed , because they have not done wisely , even with an unending shame ,
kept in memory for ever .
But, O Lord of armies, testing the upright and seeing the thoughts and the heart, let me see your punishment come on them; for I have put my cause before you.
Make melody to the Lord, give praise to the Lord: for he has made the soul of the poor man free from the hands of the evil-doers.
A curse on the day of my birth: let there be no blessing on the day when my mother had me.
A curse on the man who gave the news to my father, saying, You have a male child; making him very glad.
May that man be like the towns overturned by the Lord without mercy: let a cry for help come to his ears in the morning, and the sound of war in the middle of the day;
Because he did not put me to death before my birth took place: so my mother's body would have been my last resting-place, and she would have been with child for ever.
Why did I come from my mother's body to see pain and sorrow, so that my days might be wasted with shame?
The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur, the son of Malchiah, and Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,
Will you get directions from the Lord for us; for Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, is making war against us; it may be that the Lord will do something for us like all the wonders he has done, and make him go away from us.
Then Jeremiah said to them, This is what you are to say to Zedekiah:
The Lord God of Israel has said , See , I am turning back the instruments of war in your hands , with which you are fighting against the king of Babylon and the Chaldaeans , who are outside the walls and shutting you in ; and I will get
them together inside this town .
And I myself will be fighting against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even with angry feeling and passion and in great wrath.
And I will send a great disease on the people living in this town, on man and on beast, causing their death.
And after that , says the Lord , I will give up Zedekiah , king of Judah , and his servants and his people , even those in the town who have not come to their end from the disease and the sword and from need of food , into
the hands of Nebuchadrezzar , king of Babylon , and into the hands of their haters , and into the hands of those desiring their death : he will put them to the sword ; he will not let anyone get away , he will have no pity or mercy
And to this people you are to say, The Lord has said, See, I put before you the way of life and the way of death.
He who keeps in this town will come to his death by the sword and through need of food and through disease ; but he who goes out and gives himself up to the Chaldaeans who are shutting you in , will go on living , and will keep his
life safe .
For my face is turned to this town for evil and not for good, says the Lord: it will be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will have it burned with fire.
About the family of the king of Judah. Give ear to the word of the Lord;
O family of David , this is what the Lord has said : Do what is right in the morning , and make free from the hands of the cruel one him whose goods have been violently taken away , or my wrath will go out like fire , burning
so that no one may put it out , because of the evil of your doings .
See, I am against you, you who are living on the rock of the valley, says the Lord; you who say, Who will come down against us? or who will get into our houses?
I will send punishment on you in keeping with the fruit of your doings, says the Lord: and I will put a fire in her woodlands, burning up everything round about her.
This is what the Lord has said: Go down to the house of the king of Judah and there give him this word,
And say, Give ear to the word of the Lord, O king of Judah, seated on the seat of David, you and your servants and your people who come in by these doors.
This is what the Lord has said : Do what is right , judging uprightly , and make free from the hands of the cruel one him whose goods have been violently taken away : do no wrong and be not violent to the man from a strange country and
the child without a father and the widow , and let not those who have done no wrong be put to death in this place .
For if you truly do this, then there will come in through the doors of this house kings seated on the seat of David, going in carriages and on horseback, he and his servants and his people
But if you do not give ear to these words, I give you my oath by myself, says the Lord, that this house will become a waste.
For this is what the Lord has said about the family of the king of Judah: You are Gilead to me, and the top of Lebanon: but, truly, I will make you waste, with towns unpeopled.
And I will make ready those who will send destruction on you, everyone armed for war: by them your best cedar-trees will be cut down and put in the fire.
And nations from all sides will go past this town, and every man will say to his neighbour, Why has the Lord done such things to this great town?
And they will say, Because they gave up the agreement of the Lord their God, and became worshippers and servants of other gods.
Let there be no weeping for the dead, and make no songs of grief for him: but make bitter weeping for him who has gone away, for he will never come back or see again the country of his birth.
For this is what the Lord has said about Shallum, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who became king in place of Josiah his father, who went out from this place: He will never come back there again:
But death will come to him in the place where they have taken him away prisoner, and he will never see this land again.
A curse is on him who is building his house by wrongdoing, and his rooms by doing what is not right; who makes use of his neighbour without payment, and gives him nothing for his work;
Who says, I will make a wide house for myself, and rooms of great size, and has windows cut out, and has it roofed with cedar and painted with bright red.
Are you to be a king because you make more use of cedar than your father? did not your father take food and drink and do right, judging in righteousness, and then it was well for him?
He was judge in the cause of the poor and those in need; then it was well. Was not this to have knowledge of me? says the Lord.
But your eyes and your heart are fixed only on profit for yourself, on causing the death of him who has done no wrong, and on violent and cruel acts.
So this is what the Lord has said about Jehoiakim , the son of Josiah , king of Judah : They will make no weeping for him , saying , Ah my brother ! or , Ah sister ! they will make no weeping for him , saying , Ah
lord ! or , Ah his glory !
They will do to him what they do to the dead body of an ass; his body will be pulled out and placed on the earth outside the doors of Jerusalem.
Go up to Lebanon and give a cry; let your voice be loud in Bashan, crying out from Abarim; for all your lovers have come to destruction
My word came to you in the time of your well-being; but you said, I will not give ear. This has been your way from your earliest years, you did not give attention to my voice.
All the keepers of your sheep will be food for the wind, and your lovers will be taken away prisoners: truly, then you will be shamed and unhonoured because of all your evil-doing.
O you who are living in Lebanon, making your living-place in the cedars, how greatly to be pitied will you be when pains come on you, as on a woman in childbirth!
By my life, says the Lord, even if Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, was the ring on my right hand, even from there I would have you pulled off;
And I will give you into the hands of those desiring your death, and into the hands of those whom you are fearing, even into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, and into the hands of the Chaldaeans.
I will send you out, and your mother who gave you birth, into another country not the land of your birth; and there death will come to you.
But to the land on which their soul's desire is fixed, they will never come back.
Is this man Coniah a broken vessel of no value? is he a vessel in which there is no pleasure? why are they violently sent out, he and his seed, into a land which is strange to them?
O earth, earth, earth, give ear to the word of the Lord!
The Lord has said , Let this man be recorded as having no children , a man who will not do well in all his life : for no man of his seed will do well , seated on the seat of the kingdom of David and ruling again in
Judah .
A curse is on the keepers who are causing the destruction and loss of the sheep of my field, says the Lord.
So this is what the Lord , the God of Israel , has said against the keepers who have the care of my people : You have let my flock be broken up , driving them away and not caring for them ; see , I will send on you
the punishment for the evil of your doings , says the Lord .
And I will get the rest of my flock together from all the countries where I have sent them, and will make them come back again to their resting-place; and they will have offspring and be increased.
And I will put over them keepers who will take care of them: never again will they be overcome with fear or be troubled, and there will not be the loss of one of them, says the Lord.
See, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will give to David a true Branch, and he will be ruling as king, acting wisely, doing what is right, and judging uprightly in the land.
In his days Judah will have salvation and Israel will be living without fear: and this is the name by which he will be named, The Lord is our righteousness.
And so, truly, the days are coming when they will say no longer, By the living Lord, who took the children of Israel up out of the land of Egypt;
But, By the living Lord, who took up the seed of Israel, and made them come out of the north country, and from all the countries where I had sent them; and they will be living in the land which is theirs.
About the prophets. My heart is broken in me, all my bones are shaking; I am like a man full of strong drink, like a man overcome by wine; because of the Lord, and because of his holy words.
For the land is full of men who are untrue to their wives ; because of the curse the land is full of grief ; the green fields of the waste land have become dry ; and they are quick to do evil , their strength is for what is
not right .
For the prophet as well as the priest is unclean; even in my house I have seen their evil-doing, says the Lord.
For this cause their steps will be slipping on their way: they will be forced on into the dark and have a fall there: for I will send evil on them in the year of their punishment, says the Lord.
And I have seen ways without sense in the prophets of Samaria; they became prophets of the Baal, causing my people Israel to go wrong.
And in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a shocking thing ; they are untrue to their wives , walking in deceit , and they make strong the hands of evil-doers , so that a man may not be turned back from his evil-doing : they have all become
like Sodom to me , and its people like Gomorrah .
So this is what the Lord of armies has said about the prophets: See, I will give them a bitter plant for their food, and bitter water for their drink: for from the prophets of Jerusalem unclean behaviour has gone out into all the land.
This is what the Lord of armies has said : Do not give ear to the words which the prophets say to you : they give you teaching of no value : it is from themselves that their vision comes , and not out of the mouth of the Lord
They keep on saying to those who have no respect for the word of the Lord, You will have peace; and to everyone who goes on his way in the pride of his heart, they say, No evil will come to you.
For which of them has knowledge of the secret of the Lord, and has seen him, and given ear to his word? which of them has taken note of his word and given attention to it?
See, the storm-wind of the Lord, even the heat of his wrath, has gone out, a rolling storm, bursting on the heads of the evil-doers.
The wrath of the Lord will not be turned back till he has done, till he has put into effect, the purposes of his heart: in days to come you will have full knowledge of this.
I did not send these prophets, but they went running: I said nothing to them, but they gave out the prophet's word.
But if they had been in my secret, then they would have made my people give ear to my words, turning them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.
Am I only a God who is near, says the Lord, and not a God at a distance?
In what secret place may a man take cover without my seeing him? says the Lord. Is there any place in heaven or earth where I am not? says the Lord.
My ears have been open to what the prophets have said, who say false words in my name, saying, I have had a dream, I have had a dream, I have had a dream,
Is (my word) in the hearts of the prophets who give out false words, even the prophets of the deceit of their hearts?
Whose purpose is to take away the memory of my name from my people by their dreams, of which every man is talking to his neighbour, as their fathers gave up the memory of my name for the Baal.
If a prophet has a dream, let him give out his dream; and he who has my word, let him give out my word in good faith. What has the dry stem to do with the grain? says the Lord.
Is not my word like fire? says the Lord; and like a hammer, smashing the rock to bits?
For this cause I am against the prophets, says the Lord, who take my words, every one from his neighbour.
See, I am against the prophets, says the Lord, who let their tongues say, He has said.
See , I am against the prophets of false dreams , says the Lord , who give them out and make my people go out of the way by their deceit and their uncontrolled words : but I did not send them or give them orders ; and they will
be of no profit to this people , says the Lord .
And if this people , or the prophet , or a priest , questioning you , says , What word of weight is there from the Lord ? then you are to say to them , You are the word , for I will not be troubled with you any
more , says the Lord .
And as for the prophet and the priest and the people who say, A word of weight from the Lord! I will send punishment on that man and on his house.
But this is what you are to say, every man to his neighbour and every man to his brother, What answer has the Lord given? and, What has the Lord said?
And you will no longer put people in mind of the word of weight of the Lord : for every man ' s word will be a weight on himself ; for the words of the living God , of the Lord of armies , our God , have been
twisted by you .
This is what you are to say to the prophet, What answer has the Lord given to you? and, What has the Lord said?
But if you say , The word of weight of the Lord ; this is what the Lord has said : Because you say , The weight of the Lord , and I have sent to you , saying , You are not to say , The weight of the
Lord ;
For this reason, truly, I will put you completely out of my memory, and I will put you, and the town which I gave to you and to your fathers, away from before my face:
And I will give you a name without honour for ever, and unending shame which will never go from the memory of men.
The Lord gave me a vision , and I saw two baskets full of figs put in front of the Temple of the Lord , after Nebuchadrezzar , king of Babylon , had taken prisoner Jeconiah , the son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , and the chiefs of
Judah , and the expert workmen and metal-workers from Jerusalem , and had taken them to Babylon .
One basket had very good figs, like the figs which first come to growth: and the other basket had very bad figs, so bad that they were of no use for food.
Then the Lord said to me, What do you see, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs are very good, and the bad very bad, and of no use for food, they are so bad.
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, has said: Like these good figs, so in my eyes will be the prisoners of Judah, whom I have sent from this place into the land of the Chaldaeans for their good.
For I will keep my eyes on them for good, and I will take them back again to this land, building them up and not pulling them down, planting them and not uprooting them.
And I will give them a heart to have knowledge of me, that I am the Lord: and they will be my people, and I will be their God: for they will come back to me with all their heart.
And like the bad figs which are so bad that they are of no use for food , so I will give up Zedekiah , king of Judah , and his chiefs and the rest of Jerusalem who are still in this land , and those who are in the
land of Egypt :
I will give them up to be a cause of fear and of trouble among all the kingdoms of the earth; to be a name of shame and common talk and a cutting word and a curse in all the places wherever I will send them wandering.
And I will send the sword, and need of food, and disease, among them till they are all cut off from the land which I gave to them and to their fathers.
The word which came to Jeremiah about all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah king of Judah; this was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon.
This word Jeremiah gave out to all the people of Judah and to those living in Jerusalem, saying,
From the thirteenth year of Josiah , the son of Amon , king of Judah , even till this day , for twenty-three years , the word of the Lord has been coming to me , and I have given it to you , getting up early and talking to
you ; but you have not given ear .
And the Lord has sent to you all his servants the prophets, getting up early and sending them; but you have not given attention and your ear has not been open to give hearing;
Saying, Come back now, everyone from his evil way and from the evil of your doings, and keep your place in the land which the Lord has given to you and to your fathers, from times long past even for ever:
Do not go after other gods to be their servants and to give them worship, and do not make me angry with the work of your hands, causing evil to yourselves.
But you have not given ear to me, says the Lord; so that you have made me angry with the work of your hands, causing evil to yourselves.
So this is what the Lord of armies has said: Because you have not given ear to my words,
See , I will send and take all the families of the north , says the Lord , and Nebuchadrezzar , king of Babylon , my servant , and make them come against this land , and against its people , and against all these nations on every side ;
and I will give them up to complete destruction , and make them a cause of fear and surprise and a waste place for ever .
And more than this, I will take from them the sound of laughing voices, the voice of joy, the voice of the newly-married man, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the stones crushing the grain, and the shining of lights.
All this land will be a waste and a cause of wonder; and these nations will be the servants of the king of Babylon for seventy years.
And it will come about , after seventy years are ended , that I will send punishment on the king of Babylon , and on that nation , says the Lord , for their evil-doing , and on the land of the Chaldaeans ; and I will make it a
waste for ever .
And I will make that land undergo everything I have said against it, even everything recorded in this book, which Jeremiah the prophet has said against all the nations.
For a number of nations and great kings will make servants of them, even of them: and I will give them the reward of their acts, even the reward of the work of their hands.
For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, has said to me: Take the cup of the wine of this wrath from my hand, and make all the nations to whom I send you take of it.
And after drinking it, they will go rolling from side to side, and be off their heads, because of the sword which I will send among them.
Then I took the cup from the Lord's hand, and gave a drink from it to all the nations to whom the Lord sent me;
Jerusalem and the towns of Judah and their kings and their princes, to make them a waste place, a cause of fear and surprise and a curse, as it is this day;
Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and his servants and his princes and all his people;
And all the mixed people and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon and Gaza and Ekron and the rest of Ashdod;
Edom and Moab and the children of Ammon,
And all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the lands across the sea;
Dedan and Tema and Buz, and all who have the ends of their hair cut;
And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed people living in the waste land;
And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;
And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.
And you are to say to them , This is what the Lord of armies , the God of Israel , has said : Take of this cup and be overcome , and let it come out again from your lips , and from your fall you will never be
lifted up again , because of the sword which I will send among you .
And it will be, if they will not take of the cup in your hand, then you are to say to them, This is what the Lord of armies has said: You will certainly take of it.
For see , I am starting to send evil on the town which is named by my name , and are you to be without any punishment ? You will not be without punishment : for I will send a sword on all people living on the earth , says
the Lord of armies .
So , as a prophet , give out these words among them , and say to them , The voice of the Lord will be sounding like a lion from on high ; he will send out his voice from his holy place , like the loud voice of a
lion , against his flock ; he will give a cry , like those who are crushing the grapes , against all the people of the earth .
A noise will come, even to the end of the earth; for the Lord has a cause against the nations, he will give his decision against all flesh; as for the evil-doers, he will give them to the sword, says the Lord.
This is what the Lord of armies has said: See, evil is going out from nation to nation, and a great storm will come up from the inmost parts of the earth.
And at that day , the bodies of those whom the Lord has put to death will be seen from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth : there will be no weeping for them , their bodies will not be taken up or
put to rest in the earth ; they will be like waste on the face of the land .
Give cries of grief , you keepers of sheep ; give cries for help , rolling yourselves in the dust , you chiefs of the flock : for the days of your destruction have fully come , and I will send you in all directions , and your fall will
be like that of the males of the flock .
There will be no way of flight for the keepers of sheep, no road for the chiefs of the flock to get away safely.
A sound of the cry of the keepers of sheep, and the bitter crying of the chiefs of the flock! for the Lord has made waste their green fields.
And there is no sound in the fields of peace, because of the burning wrath of the Lord.
The lion has come out of his secret place, for the land has become a waste because of the cruel sword, and because of the heat of his wrath.
When Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, first became king, this word came from the Lord, saying,
This is what the Lord has said : Take your place in the open square of the Lord ' s house and say to all the towns of Judah , who come into the Lord ' s house for worship , everything I give you orders to say to them
: keep back not a word ;
It may be that they will give ear, and that every man will be turned from his evil way, so that my purpose of sending evil on them because of the evil of their doings may be changed.
And you are to say to them, This is what the Lord has said: If you do not give ear to me and go in the way of my law which I have put before you,
And give ear to the words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you, getting up early and sending them, though you gave no attention;
Then I will make this house like Shiloh, and will make this town a curse to all the nations of the earth.
And in the hearing of the priests and the prophets and all the people, Jeremiah said these words in the house of the Lord.
Now, when Jeremiah had come to the end of saying everything the Lord had given him orders to say to all the people, the priests and the prophets and all the people took him by force, saying, Death will certainly be your fate.
Why have you said in the name of the Lord, This house will be like Shiloh, and this land a waste with no one living in it? And all the people had come together to Jeremiah in the house of the Lord.
And the rulers of Judah, hearing of these things, came up from the king's house to the house of the Lord, and took their seats by the new door of the Lord's house.
Then the priests and the prophets said to the rulers and to all the people, The right fate for this man is death; for he has said words against this town in your hearing.
Then Jeremiah said to all the rulers and to all the people, The Lord has sent me as his prophet to say against this house and against this town all the words which have come to your ears.
So now, make a change for the better in your ways and your doings, and give ear to the voice of the Lord your God; then the Lord will let himself be turned from the decision he has made against you for evil.
As for me, here I am in your hands: do with me whatever seems good and right in your opinion.
Only be certain that , if you put me to death , you will make yourselves and your town and its people responsible for the blood of one who has done no wrong : for truly , the Lord has sent me to you to say all these words in
your ears .
Then the rulers and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, It is not right for this man to be put to death: for he has said words to us in the name of the Lord our God.
Then some of the responsible men of the land got up and said to all the meeting of the people,
Micah the Morashtite , who was a prophet in the days of Hezekiah , king of Judah , said to all the people of Judah , This is what the Lord of armies has said : Zion will become like a ploughed field , and Jerusalem will become a mass
of broken walls , and the mountain of the house like the high places of the woodland .
Did Hezekiah and all Judah put him to death ? did he not in the fear of the Lord make prayer for the grace of the Lord , and the Lord let himself be turned from the decision he had made against them for evil ? By this act we
might do great evil against ourselves .
And there was another man who was a prophet of the Lord, Uriah, the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath-jearim; he said against this town and against this land all the words which Jeremiah had said:
And when his words came to the ears of Jehoiakim the king and all his men of war and his captains, the king would have put him to death; but Uriah, hearing of it, was full of fear and went in flight into Egypt:
And Jehoiakim the king sent Elnathan, the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt.
And they took Uriah out of Egypt and came back with him to Jehoiakim the king; who put him to death with the sword, and had his dead body put into the resting-place of the bodies of the common people.
But Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, gave Jeremiah his help, so that he was not given into the hands of the people to be put to death.
When Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, first became king this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,
This is what the Lord has said to me: Make for yourself bands and yokes and put them on your neck;
And send them to the king of Edom , and to the king of Moab , and to the king of the children of Ammon , and to the king of Tyre , and to the king of Zidon , by their servants who come to Jerusalem , to Zedekiah
, king of Judah ;
And give them orders to say to their masters, This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: Say to your masters,
I have made the earth, and man and beast on the face of the earth, by my great power and by my outstretched arm; and I will give it to anyone at my pleasure.
And now I have given all these lands into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant; and I have given the beasts of the field to him for his use.
And all the nations will be servants to him and to his son and to his son's son, till the time comes for his land to be overcome: and then a number of nations and great kings will take it for their use.
And it will come about , that if any nation does not become a servant to this same Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , and does not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon , then I will send punishment on that nation , says the
Lord , by the sword and need of food and by disease , till I have given them into his hands .
And you are not to give attention to your prophets or your readers of signs or your dreamers or those who see into the future or those who make use of secret arts, who say to you, You will not become servants of the king of Babylon:
For they say false words to you, so that you may be sent away far from your land, and so that you may be forced out by me and come to destruction.
But as for that nation which puts its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and becomes his servant, I will let that nation keep on in its land, farming it and living in it, says the Lord.
And I said all this to Zedekiah, king of Judah, saying, Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and become his servants and his people, so that you may keep your lives.
Why are you desiring death, you and your people, by the sword, and because food is gone, and by disease, as the Lord has said of the nation which does not become the servant of the king of Babylon?
And you are not to give ear to the prophets who say to you, You will not become servants of the king of Babylon: for what they say is not true.
For I have not sent them, says the Lord, but they are saying what is false in my name, so that I might send you out by force, causing destruction to come on you and on your prophets.
And I said to the priests and to all the people , This is what the Lord has said : Give no attention to the words of your prophets who say to you , See , in a very little time now the vessels of the Lord ' s house
will come back again from Babylon : for what they say to you is false .
Give no attention to them; become servants of the king of Babylon and keep yourselves from death: why let this town become a waste?
But if they are prophets , and if the word of the Lord is with them , let them now make request to the Lord of armies that the vessels which are still in the house of the Lord and in the house of the king of Judah and at
Jerusalem , may not go to Babylon .
For this is what the Lord has said about the rest of the vessels which are still in this town,
Which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, did not take away, when he took Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, a prisoner from Jerusalem to Babylon, with all the great men of Judah and Jerusalem;
For this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said about the rest of the vessels in the house of the Lord and in the house of the king of Judah and at Jerusalem:
They will be taken away to Babylon, and there they will be till the day when I send their punishment on them, says the Lord. Then I will take them up and put them back in their place.
And it came about in that year , when Zedekiah first became king of Judah , in the fourth year , in the fifth month , that Hananiah , the son of Azzur the prophet , who came from Gibeon , said to Jeremiah in the house of the Lord
, before the priests and all the people ,
These are the words of the Lord of armies, the God of Israel: By me the yoke of the king of Babylon has been broken.
In the space of two years I will send back into this place all the vessels of the Lord's house which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, took away from this place to Babylon:
And I will let Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, come back to this place, with all the prisoners of Judah who went to Babylon, says the Lord: for I will have the yoke of the king of Babylon broken.
Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah, before the priests and all the people who had come into the house of the Lord,
The prophet Jeremiah said , So be it : may the Lord do so : may the Lord give effect to the words which you have said , and let the vessels of the Lord ' s house , and all the people who have been taken away , come
back from Babylon to this place .
But still, give ear to this word which I am saying to you and to all the people:
The prophets, who were before me and before you, from early times gave word to a number of countries and great kingdoms about war and destruction and disease.
The prophet whose words are of peace, when his words come true, will be seen to be a prophet whom the Lord has sent.
Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and it was broken by his hands.
And before all the people Hananiah said, The Lord has said, Even so will I let the yoke of the king of Babylon be broken off the necks of all the nations in the space of two years. Then the prophet Jeremiah went away.
Then after the yoke had been broken off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah by Hananiah the prophet, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,
Go and say to Hananiah, This is what the Lord has said: Yokes of wood have been broken by you, but in their place I will make yokes of iron.
For the Lord of armies , the God of Israel , has said : I have put a yoke of iron on the necks of all these nations , making them servants to Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon ; and they are to be his servants : and in addition
I have given him the beasts of the field .
Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, Give ear, now, Hananiah; the Lord has not sent you; but you are making this people put their faith in what is false.
For this reason the Lord has said, See, I will send you away from off the face of the earth: this year death will overtake you, because you have said words against the Lord.
So death came to Hananiah the prophet the same year, in the seventh month.
Now these are the words of the letter which Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the responsible men among those who had been taken away , and to the priests and the prophets and to all the rest of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken away prisoners from Jerusalem
to Babylon ;
(After Jeconiah the king and the queen-mother and the unsexed servants and the rulers of Judah and Jerusalem and the expert workmen and the metal-workers had gone away from Jerusalem;)
By the hand of Elasah, the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah, the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah, king of Judah, sent to Babylon, to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,) saying,
This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said to all those whom I have taken away prisoners from Jerusalem to Babylon:
Go on building houses and living in them, and planting gardens and using the fruit of them;
Take wives and have sons and daughters, and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, so that they may have sons and daughters; and be increased in number there and do not become less.
And be working for the peace of the land to which I have had you taken away prisoners, and make prayer to the Lord for it: for in its peace you will have peace.
For this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: Do not let yourselves be tricked by the prophets who are among you, and the readers of signs, and give no attention to their dreams which they may have;
For they are saying to you what is false in my name: I have not sent them, says the Lord.
For this is what the Lord has said: When seventy years are ended for Babylon, I will have pity on you and give effect to my good purpose for you, causing you to come back to this place.
For I am conscious of my thoughts about you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you hope at the end.
And you will go on crying to me and making prayer to me, and I will give ear to you.
And you will be searching for me and I will be there, when you have gone after me with all your heart.
I will be near you again , says the Lord , and your fate will be changed , and I will get you together from all the nations and from all the places where I had sent you away , says the Lord ; and I will take you back
again to the place from which I sent you away prisoners .
For you have said, The Lord has given us prophets in Babylon.
For this is what the Lord has said about the king who is seated on the seat of David's kingdom, and about all the people living in this town, your countrymen who have not gone out with you as prisoners;
This is what the Lord of armies has said: See, I will send on them the sword and need of food and disease, and will make them like bad figs, which are of no use for food, they are so bad.
I will go after them , attacking them with the sword and with need of food and with disease , and will make them a cause of fear to all the kingdoms of the earth , to be a curse and a wonder and a surprise and a name of
shame among all the nations where I have sent them :
Because they have not given ear to my words, says the Lord, when I sent to them my servants the prophets, getting up early and sending them; but you did not give ear, says the Lord.
And now, give ear to the word of the Lord, all you whom I have sent away prisoners from Jerusalem to Babylon.
This is what the Lord of armies , the God of Israel , has said about Ahab , the son of Kolaiah , and about Zedekiah , the son of Maaseiah , who are saying to you what is false in my name : See , I will give them
up into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar , king of Babylon , and he will put them to death before your eyes .
And their fate will be used as a curse by all the prisoners of Judah who are in Babylon, who will say, May the Lord make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, who were burned in the fire by the king of Babylon;
Because they have done shame in Israel, and have taken their neighbours' wives, and in my name have said false words, which I did not give them orders to say; and I myself am the witness, says the Lord.
About Shemaiah the Nehelamite.
Shemaiah the Nehelamite sent a letter in his name to Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,
The Lord has made you priest in place of Jehoiada the priest, to be an overseer in the house of the Lord for every man who is off his head and is acting as a prophet, to put such men in prison and in chains.
So why have you made no protest against Jeremiah of Anathoth, who is acting as a prophet to you?
For he has sent to us in Babylon saying, The time will be long: go on building houses and living in them, and planting gardens and using the fruit of them.
And Zephaniah the priest made clear to Jeremiah the prophet what was said in the letter, reading it to him.
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
Send to all those who have been taken away , saying , This is what the Lord has said about Shemaiah the Nehelamite : Because Shemaiah has been acting as a prophet to you , and I did not send him , and has made you put your faith in
what is false ;
For this cause the Lord has said , Truly I will send punishment on Shemaiah and on his seed ; not a man of his family will have a place among this people , and he will not see the good which I am going to do to my people
, says the Lord : because he has said words against the Lord .
They say , If a man puts away his wife and she goes from him and becomes another man ' s , will he go back to her again ? will not that land have been made unclean ? but though you have been acting like a loose woman with
a number of lovers , will you now come back to me ? says the Lord .
Let your eyes be lifted up to the open hilltops , and see ; where have you not been taken by your lovers ? You have been seated waiting for them by the wayside like an Arabian in the waste land ; you have made the land unclean with your
loose ways and your evil-doing .
So the showers have been kept back, and there has been no spring rain; still your brow is the brow of a loose woman, you will not let yourself be shamed.
Will you not, from this time, make your prayer to me, crying, My father, you are the friend of my early years?
Will he be angry for ever? will he keep his wrath to the end? These things you have said, and have done evil and have had your way.
And the Lord said to me in the days of Josiah the king, Have you seen what Israel, turning away from me, has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and under every branching tree, acting like a loose woman there.
And I said, After she has done all these things she will come back to me; but she did not. And her false sister Judah saw it.
And though she saw that , because Israel , turning away from me , had been untrue to me , I had put her away and given her a statement in writing ending the relation between us , still Judah , her false sister , had no fear , but
went and did the same .
So that through all her loose behaviour the land became unclean, and she was untrue, giving herself to stones and trees.
But for all this, her false sister Judah has not come back to me with all her heart, but with deceit, says the Lord.
And the Lord said to me, Israel in her turning away is seen to be more upright than false Judah.
Go , and give out these words to the north , and say , Come back , O Israel , though you have been turned away from me , says the Lord ; my face will not be against you in wrath : for I am full of mercy ,
says the Lord , I will not be angry for ever .
Only be conscious of your sin, the evil you have done against the Lord your God; you have gone with strange men under every branching tree, giving no attention to my voice, says the Lord.
Come back, O children who are turned away, says the Lord; for I am a husband to you, and I will take you, one from a town and two from a family, and will make you come to Zion;
And I will give you keepers, pleasing to my heart, who will give you your food with knowledge and wisdom.
And it will come about , when your numbers are increased in the land , in those days , says the Lord , that they will no longer say , The ark of the agreement of the Lord : it will not come into their minds , they will not
have any memory of it , or be conscious of the loss of it , and it will not be made again .
At that time Jerusalem will be named the seat of the Lord ' s kingdom ; and all the nations will come together to it , to the name of the Lord , to Jerusalem : and no longer will their steps be guided by the purposes of their evil
hearts .
In those days the family of Judah will go with the family of Israel, and they will come together out of the land of the north into the land which I gave for a heritage to your fathers.
But I said , How am I to put you among the children , and give you a desired land , a heritage of glory among the armies of the nations ? and I said , You are to say to me , My father ; and not be turned
away from me .
Truly, as a wife is false to her husband, so have you been false to me, O Israel, says the Lord.
A voice is sounding on the open hilltops, the weeping and the prayers of the children of Israel; because their way is twisted, they have not kept the Lord their God in mind.
Come back, you children who have been turned away, and I will take away your desire for wandering. See, we have come to you, for you are the Lord our God.
Truly, the hills, and the noise of an army on the mountains, are a false hope: truly, in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel.
But the Baal has taken all the work of our fathers from our earliest days; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
Let us be stretched on the earth in our downfall , covering ourselves with our shame : for we have been sinners against the Lord our God , we and our fathers , from our earliest years even till this day : and we have not given ear to the
voice of the Lord our God .
The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,
The Lord, the God of Israel, has said, Put down in a book all the words which I have said to you.
For see , the days are coming , says the Lord , when I will let the fate of my people Israel and Judah be changed , says the Lord : and I will make them come back to the land which I gave to their fathers , so that
they may take it for their heritage .
And these are the words which the Lord said about Israel and about Judah.
This is what the Lord has said: A voice of shaking fear has come to our ears, of fear and not of peace.
Put the question and see if it is possible for a man to have birth-pains: why do I see every man with his hands gripping his sides, as a woman does when the pains of birth are on her, and all faces are turned green?
Ha! for that day is so great that there is no day like it: it is the time of Jacob's trouble: but he will get salvation from it.
For it will come about on that day, says the Lord of armies, that his yoke will be broken off his neck, and his bands will be burst; and men of strange lands will no longer make use of him as their servant:
But they will be servants to the Lord their God and to David their king, whom I will give back to them.
So have no fear , O Jacob , my servant , says the Lord ; and do not be troubled , O Israel : for see , I will make you come back from far away , and your seed from the land where they are prisoners ; and Jacob
will come back , and will be quiet and at peace , and no one will give him cause for fear .
For I am with you , says the Lord , to be your saviour : for I will put an end to all the nations where I have sent you wandering , but I will not put an end to you completely : though with wise purpose I will put
right your errors , and will not let you go quite without punishment .
For the Lord has said, Your disease may not be made well and your wound is bitter.
There is no help for your wound, there is nothing to make you well.
Your lovers have no more thought for you, they go after you no longer; for I have given you the wound of a hater, even cruel punishment;
Why are you crying for help because of your wound? for your pain may never be taken away: because your evil-doing was so great and because your sins were increased, I have done these things to you.
For this cause , all those who take you for their food will themselves become your food ; and all your attackers , every one of them , will be taken prisoners ; and those who send destruction on you will come to destruction ; and all those who take
away your goods by force will undergo the same themselves .
For I will make you healthy again and I will make you well from your wounds, says the Lord; because they have given you the name of an outlaw, saying, It is Zion cared for by no man.
The Lord has said, See, I am changing the fate of the tents of Jacob, and I will have pity on his houses; the town will be put up on its hill, and the great houses will be living-places again.
And from them will go out praise and the sound of laughing: and I will make them great in number, and they will not become less; and I will give them glory, and they will not be small.
And their children will be as they were in the old days, and the meeting of the people will have its place before me, and I will send punishment on all who are cruel to them.
And their chief will be of their number ; their ruler will come from among themselves ; and I will let him be present before me , so that he may come near to me : for who may have strength of heart to come near me ? says the
Lord .
And you will be my people, and I will be your God.
See, the storm-wind of the Lord, even the heat of his wrath, has gone out, a rolling storm, bursting on the heads of the evil-doers.
The wrath of the Lord will not be turned back till he has done, till he has put into effect, the purposes of his heart: in days to come you will have full knowledge of this.
At that time, says the Lord, I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they will be my people.
The Lord has said, Grace came in the waste land to a people kept safe from the sword, even to Israel on the way to his resting-place.
From far away he saw the Lord: my love for you is an eternal love: so with mercy I have made you come with me.
I will again make new your buildings, O virgin of Israel, and you will take up your place: again you will take up your instruments of music, and go out in the dances of those who are glad.
Again will your vine-gardens be planted on the hill of Samaria: the planters will be planting and using the fruit.
For there will be a day when those who get in the grapes on the hills of Ephraim will be crying, Up! let us go up to Zion to the Lord our God.
For the Lord has said, Make a glad song for Jacob and give a cry on the top of the mountains: give the news, give praise, and say, The Lord has given salvation to his people, even to the rest of Israel.
See , I will take them from the north country , and get them from the inmost parts of the earth , and with them the blind and the feeble-footed , the woman with child and her who is in birth-pains together : a very great army , they will
come back here .
They will come with weeping, and going before them I will be their guide: guiding them by streams of water in a straight way where there is no falling: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is the first of my sons.
Give ear to the word of the Lord, O you nations, and give news of it in the sea-lands far away, and say, He who has sent Israel wandering will get him together and will keep him as a keeper does his flock.
For the Lord has given a price for Jacob, and made him free from the hands of him who was stronger than he.
So they will come with songs on the high places , flowing together to the good things of the Lord , to the grain and the wine and the oil , to the young ones of the flock and of the herd : their souls will be like a watered
garden , and they will have no more sorrow .
Then the virgin will have joy in the dance, and the young men and the old will be glad: for I will have their weeping turned into joy, I will give them comfort and make them glad after their sorrow.
I will give the priests their desired fat things, and my people will have a full measure of my good things, says the Lord.
So has the Lord said: In Ramah there is a sound of crying, weeping and bitter sorrow; Rachel weeping for her children; she will not be comforted for their loss.
The Lord has said this: Keep your voice from sorrow and your eyes from weeping: for your work will be rewarded, says the Lord; and they will come back from the land of their hater.
And there is hope for the future, says the Lord; and your children will come back to the land which is theirs.
Certainly Ephraim's words of grief have come to my ears, You have given me training and I have undergone it like a young cow unused to the yoke: let me be turned and come back, for you are the Lord my God.
Truly , after I had been turned , I had regret for my ways ; and after I had got knowledge , I made signs of sorrow : I was put to shame , truly , I was covered with shame , because I had to undergo the shame of
my early years .
Is Ephraim my dear son? is he the child of my delight? for whenever I say things against him, I still keep him in my memory: so my heart is troubled for him; I will certainly have mercy on him, says the Lord.
Put up guiding pillars, make road signs for yourself: give attention to the highway, even the way in which you went: be turned again, O virgin of Israel, be turned to these your towns.
How long will you go on turning this way and that, O wandering daughter? for the Lord has made a new thing on the earth, a woman changed into a man.
So the Lord of armies , the God of Israel , has said , Again will these words be used in the land of Judah and in its towns , when I have let their fate be changed : May the blessing of the Lord be on you , O
resting-place of righteousness , O holy mountain .
And Judah and all its towns will be living there together; the farmers and those who go about with flocks.
For I have given new strength to the tired soul and to every sorrowing soul in full measure.
At this, awaking from my sleep, I saw; and my sleep was sweet to me.
See, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will have Israel and Judah planted with the seed of man and with the seed of beast.
And it will come about that , as I have been watching over them for the purpose of uprooting and smashing down and overturning and sending destruction and causing trouble ; so I will be watching over them for the purpose of building up and planting , says the Lord
In those days they will no longer say, The fathers have been tasting bitter grapes and the children's teeth are put on edge.
But everyone will be put to death for the evil which he himself has done: whoever has taken bitter grapes will himself have his teeth put on edge.
See, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah:
Not like the agreement which I made with their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to be their guide out of the land of Egypt; which agreement was broken by them, and I gave them up, says the Lord.
But this is the agreement which I will make with the people of Israel after those days , says the Lord ; I will put my law in their inner parts , writing it in their hearts ; and I will be their God , and they will be my
people .
And no longer will they be teaching every man his neighbour and every man his brother , saying , Get knowledge of the Lord : for they will all have knowledge of me , from the least of them to the greatest of them , says the Lord : for
they will have my forgiveness for their evil-doing , and their sin will go from my memory for ever .
These are the words of the Lord , who has given the sun for a light by day , ordering the moon and stars for a light by night , who puts the sea in motion , causing the thunder of its waves ; the Lord of armies is his
name .
If the order of these things before me is ever broken, says the Lord, then will the seed of Israel come to an end as a nation before me for ever.
This is what the Lord has said: If the heavens on high may be measured, and the bases of the earth searched out, then I will give up the seed of Israel, because of all they have done, says the Lord.
See, the days are coming, says the Lord, for the building of the Lord's town, from the tower of Hananel to the doorway of the angle.
And the measuring-line will go out in front of it as far as the hill Gareb, going round to Goah.
And all the valley of the dead bodies , and all the field of death as far as the stream Kidron , up to the angle of the horses ' doorway to the east , will be holy to the Lord ; it will not again be uprooted or overturned
for ever .
The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.
Now at that time the king of Babylon's army was round Jerusalem, shutting it in: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the place of the armed watchmen, in the house of the king of Judah.
For Zedekiah , king of Judah , had had him shut up , saying , Why have you , as a prophet , been saying , The Lord has said , See , I will give this town into the hands of the king of Babylon , and he will
take it ;
And Zedekiah , king of Judah , will not get away from the hands of the Chaldaeans , but will certainly be given up into the hands of the king of Babylon , and will have talk with him , mouth to mouth , and see him , eye to
eye .
And he will take Zedekiah away to Babylon, where he will be till I have pity on him, says the Lord: though you are fighting with the Chaldaeans, things will not go well for you?
And Jeremiah said, The word of the Lord came to me, saying,
See, Hanamel, the son of Shallum, your father's brother, will come to you and say, Give the price and get for yourself my property in Anathoth: for you have the right of the nearest relation.
So Hanamel , the son of my father ' s brother , came to me , as the Lord had said , to the place of the armed watchmen , and said to me , Give the price and get my property which is in Anathoth in the land of
Benjamin : for you have the nearest relation ' s right to the heritage ; so get it for yourself . Then it was clear to me that this was the word of the Lord .
So I got for a price the property in Anathoth from Hanamel, the son of my father's brother, and gave him the money, seventeen shekels of silver;
And I put it in writing, stamping it with my stamp, and I took witnesses and put the money into the scales.
So I took the paper witnessing the business, one copy rolled up and stamped, and one copy open:
And I gave the paper to Baruch , the son of Neriah , the son of Mahseiah , before the eyes of Hanamel , the son of my father ' s brother , and of the witnesses who had put their names to the paper , and before all the
Jews who were seated in the place of the armed watchmen .
And I gave orders to Baruch in front of them, saying,
This is what the Lord of armies , the God of Israel , has said : Take these papers , the witness of this business , the one which is rolled up and stamped , and the one which is open ; and put them in a vessel of earth
so that they may be kept for a long time .
For the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said, There will again be trading in houses and fields and vine-gardens in this land.
Now after I had given the paper to Baruch, the son of Neriah, I made my prayer to the Lord, saying,
Ah Lord God! see, you have made the heaven and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm, and there is nothing you are not able to do:
You have mercy on thousands, and send punishment for the evil-doing of the fathers on their children after them: the great, the strong God, the Lord of armies is his name:
Great in wisdom and strong in act: whose eyes are open on all the ways of the sons of men, giving to everyone the reward of his ways and the fruit of his doings:
You have done signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and even to this day, in Israel and among other men; and have made a name for yourself as at this day;
And have taken your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders and with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, causing great fear;
And have given them this land, which you gave your word to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
And they came in and took it for their heritage , but they did not give ear to your voice , and were not ruled by your law ; they have done nothing of all you gave them orders to do : so you have made all this evil come
on them :
See , they have made earthworks against the town to take it ; and the town is given into the hands of the Chaldaeans who are fighting against it , because of the sword and need of food and disease : and what you have said has taken place ,
and truly you see it .
And you have said to me, Give the money to get yourself a property, and have the business witnessed; though the town is given into the hands of the Chaldaeans.
And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,
See, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: is there anything so hard that I am unable to do it?
So this is what the Lord has said: See, I am giving this town into the hands of the Chaldaeans and into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon, and he will take it:
And the Chaldaeans , who are fighting against this town , will come and put the town on fire , burning it together with the houses , on the roofs of which perfumes have been burned to the Baal , and drink offerings have been drained out to other gods
, moving me to wrath .
For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done nothing but evil in my eyes from their earliest years: the children of Israel have only made me angry with the work of their hands, says the Lord.
For this town has been to me a cause of wrath and of burning passion from the day of its building till this day, so that I put it away from before my face:
Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah , which they have done to make me angry , they and their kings , their princes , their priests , and their prophets , and the men of Judah and the people of
Jerusalem .
And they have been turning their backs and not their faces to me: and though I was their teacher, getting up early and teaching them, their ears were not open to teaching.
But they put their disgusting images into the house which is named by my name, making it unclean.
And they put up the high places of the Baal in the valley of the son of Hinnom , making their sons and their daughters go through the fire to Molech ; which I did not give them orders to do , and it never came into my mind that
they would do this disgusting thing , causing Judah to be turned out of the way .
And now the Lord, the God of Israel, has said of this town, about which you say, It is given into the hands of the king of Babylon by the sword and by need of food and by disease:
See, I will get them together from all the countries where I have sent them in my wrath and in the heat of my passion and in my bitter feeling; and I will let them come back into this place where they may take their rest safely.
And they will be my people, and I will be their God:
And I will give them one heart and one way, so that they may go on in the worship of me for ever, for their good and the good of their children after them:
And I will make an eternal agreement with them, that I will never give them up, but ever do them good; and I will put the fear of me in their hearts, so that they will not go away from me.
And truly, I will take pleasure in doing them good, and all my heart and soul will be given to planting them in this land in good faith.
For the Lord has said: As I have made all this great evil come on this people, so I will send on them all the good which I said about them.
And there will be trading in fields in this land of which you say, It is a waste, without man or beast; it is given into the hands of the Chaldaeans.
Men will get fields for money , and put the business in writing , stamping the papers and having them witnessed , in the land of Benjamin and in the country round Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah and in the towns of the hill-country and in the towns
of the lowland and in the towns of the South : for I will let their fate be changed , says the Lord .
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was still shut up in the place of the armed watchmen, saying,
These are the words of the Lord, who is doing it, the Lord who is forming it, to make it certain; the Lord is his name;
Let your cry come to me, and I will give you an answer, and let you see great things and secret things of which you had no knowledge.
For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, has said about the houses of this town and the houses of the kings of Judah, which have been broken down to make earthworks and ...;
... and to make them full of the dead bodies of men whom I have put to death in my wrath and in my passion, and because of whose evil-doing I have kept my face covered from this town.
See, I will make it healthy and well again, I will even make them well; I will let them see peace and good faith in full measure.
And I will let the fate of Judah and of Israel be changed, building them up as at first.
And I will make them clean from all their sin, with which they have been sinning against me; I will have forgiveness for all their sins, with which they have been sinning against me, and with which they have done evil against me.
And this town will be to me for a name of joy , for a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth , who , hearing of all the good which I am doing for them , will be shaking with fear because of all the
good and the peace which I am doing for it .
This is what the Lord has said : There will again be sounding in this place , of which you say , It is a waste , without man and without beast ; even in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem which are waste and unpeopled
, without man and without beast ,
Happy sounds , the voice of joy , the voice of the newly-married man and the voice of the bride , the voices of those who say , Give praise to the Lord of armies , for the Lord is good , for his mercy is unchanging for ever :
the voices of those who go with praise into the house of the Lord . For I will let the land come back to its first condition , says the Lord .
This is what the Lord of armies has said: Again there will be in this place, which is a waste, without man and without beast, and in all its towns, a resting-place where the keepers of sheep will make their flocks take rest.
In the towns of the hill-country , in the towns of the lowland , and in the towns of the South and in the land of Benjamin and in the country round Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah , the flocks will again go under the hand of him
who is numbering them , says the Lord .
See, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will give effect to the good word which I have said about the people of Israel and the people of Judah.
In those days and at that time, I will let a Branch of righteousness come up for David; and he will be a judge in righteousness in the land.
In those days, Judah will have salvation and Jerusalem will be safe: and this is the name which will be given to her: The Lord is our righteousness.
For the Lord has said, David will never be without a man to take his place on the seat of the kingdom of Israel;
And the priests and the Levites will never be without a man to come before me, offering burned offerings and perfumes and meal offerings and offerings of beasts at all times.
And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,
The Lord has said: If it is possible for my agreement of the day and the night to be broken, so that day and night no longer come at their fixed times,
Then my agreement with my servant David may be broken, so that he no longer has a son to take his place on the seat of the kingdom; and my agreement with the Levites, the priests, my servants.
As it is not possible for the army of heaven to be numbered, or the sand of the sea measured, so will I make the seed of my servant David, and the Levites my servants.
And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,
Have you taken note of what these people have said, The two families, which the Lord took for himself, he has given up? This they say, looking down on my people as being, in their eyes, no longer a nation.
The Lord has said, If I have not made day and night, and if the limits of heaven and earth have not been fixed by me,
Then I will give up caring for the seed of Jacob and of David my servant , so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob : for I will let their fate be changed and will
have mercy on them .
The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord , when Nebuchadrezzar , king of Babylon , and all his army , and all the kingdoms of the earth which were under his rule , and all the peoples , were fighting against Jerusalem and all its towns , saying
The Lord , the God of Israel , has said , Go and say to Zedekiah , king of Judah , This is what the Lord has said : See , I will give this town into the hands of the king of Babylon , and he will have it
burned with fire :
And you will not get away from him , but will certainly be taken and given up into his hands ; and you will see the king of Babylon , eye to eye , and he will have talk with you , mouth to mouth , and you will go
to Babylon .
But give ear to the word of the Lord, O Zedekiah, king of Judah; this is what the Lord has said about you: Death will not come to you by the sword:
You will come to your end in peace ; and such burnings as they made for your fathers , the earlier kings before you , will be made for you ; and they will be weeping for you and saying , Ah lord ! for I have said the word
, says the Lord .
Then Jeremiah the prophet said all these things to Zedekiah, king of Judah, in Jerusalem,
When the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the towns of Judah which had not been taken, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these were the last of the walled towns of Judah.
The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, after King Zedekiah had made an agreement with all the people in Jerusalem, to give news in public that servants were to be made free;
That every man was to let his Hebrew man-servant and his Hebrew servant-girl go free; so that no one might make use of a Jew, his countryman, as a servant:
And this was done by all the rulers and the people who had taken part in the agreement, and every one let his man-servant and his servant-girl go free, not to be used as servants any longer; they did so, and let them go.
But later, they took back again the servants and the servant-girls whom they had let go free, and put them again under the yoke as servants and servant-girls.
For this reason the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,
The Lord, the God of Israel, has said, I made an agreement with your fathers on the day when I took them out of Egypt, out of the prison-house, saying,
At the end of seven years every man is to let go his countryman who is a Hebrew , who has become yours for a price and has been your servant for six years ; you are to let him go free : but your fathers gave no attention and
did not give ear .
And now, turning away from evil, you had done what is right in my eyes, giving a public undertaking for every man to make his neighbour free; and you had made an agreement before me in the house which is named by my name:
But again you have put shame on my name, and you have taken back, every one his man-servant and his servant-girl, whom you had sent away free, and you have put them under the yoke again to be your servants and servant-girls.
And so the Lord has said , You have not given ear to me and undertaken publicly , every man to let loose his countryman and his neighbour : see , I undertake to let loose against you the sword and disease and need of food ; and I will
send you wandering among all the kingdoms of the earth .
And I will give the men who have gone against my agreement and have not given effect to the words of the agreement which they made before me, when the ox was cut in two and they went between the parts of it,
The rulers of Judah and the rulers of Jerusalem, the unsexed servants and the priests and all the people of the land who went between the parts of the ox,
Even these I will give up into the hands of their haters and into the hands of those who have designs against their lives: and their dead bodies will become food for the birds of heaven and the beasts of the earth.
And Zedekiah , king of Judah , and his rulers I will give into the hands of their haters and into the hands of those who have designs against their lives , and into the hands of the king of Babylon ' s army which has gone away from you
See, I will give orders, says the Lord, and make them come back to this town; and they will make war on it and take it and have it burned with fire: and I will make the towns of Judah waste and unpeopled.
The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, in the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,
Go into the house of the Rechabites, and have talk with them, and take them into the house of the Lord, into one of the rooms, and give them wine.
Then I took Jaazaniah, the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons and all the Rechabites;
And I took them into the house of the Lord , into the room of the sons of Hanan , the son of Igdaliah , the man of God , which was near the rulers ' room , which was over the room of Maaseiah , the son of Shallum
, the keeper of the door ;
And I put before the sons of the Rechabites basins full of wine and cups, and I said to them, Take some wine.
But they said, We will take no wine: for Jonadab, the son of Rechab our father, gave us orders, saying, You are to take no wine, you or your sons, for ever:
And you are to make no houses , or put in seed , or get vine-gardens planted , or have any : but all your days you are to go on living in tents , so that you may have a long life in the land where you are living
as in a strange country .
And we have kept the rules of Jonadab, the son of Rechab our father, in everything which he gave us orders to do, drinking no wine all our days, we and our wives and our sons and our daughters;
Building no houses for ourselves, having no vine-gardens or fields or seed:
But we have been living in tents, and have done everything which Jonadab our father gave us orders to do.
But when Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, came up into the land, we said, Come, let us go to Jerusalem, away from the army of the Chaldaeans and from the army of the Aramaeans: and so we are living in Jerusalem.
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,
This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: Go and say to the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem, Is there no hope of teaching you to give ear to my words? says the Lord.
The orders which Jonadab , the son of Rechab , gave to his sons to take no wine , are done , and to this day they take no wine , for they do the orders of their father : but I have sent my words to you , getting
up early and sending them , and you have not given ear to me .
And I have sent you all my servants the prophets , getting up early and sending them , saying , Come back , now , every man from his evil way , and do better , and go not after other gods to become their servants , and you will
go on living in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers : but your ears have not been open , and you have not given attention to me .
Though the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have done the orders of their father which he gave them, this people has not given ear to me:
For this reason the Lord , the God of armies , the God of Israel , has said , See , I will send on Judah and on all the people of Jerusalem all the evil which I said I would do to them : because I sent my words
to them , but they did not give ear ; crying out to them , but they gave no answer .
But to the Rechabites Jeremiah said , This is what the Lord of armies , the God of Israel , has said : Because you have done the orders of Jonadab your father , and have kept his rules , and done everything as he gave you orders to do
it ;
For this reason the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said, Jonadab, the son of Rechab, will never be without a man to take his place before me.
Now it came about in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,
Take a book and put down in it all the words I have said to you against Israel and against Judah and against all the nations, from the day when my word came to you in the days of Josiah till this day.
It may be that the people of Judah, hearing of all the evil which it is my purpose to do to them, will be turned, every man from his evil ways; so that they may have my forgiveness for their evil-doing and their sin.
Then Jeremiah sent for Baruch, the son of Neriah; and Baruch took down from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord which he had said to him, writing them in a book.
And Jeremiah gave orders to Baruch, saying, I am shut up, and am not able to go into the house of the Lord:
So you are to go , reading there from the book , which you have taken down from my mouth , the words of the Lord , in the hearing of the people in the Lord ' s house , on a day when they go without food , and
in the hearing of all the men of Judah who have come out from their towns .
It may be that their prayer for grace will go up to the Lord, and that every man will be turned from his evil ways: for great is the wrath and the passion made clear by the Lord against this people.
And Baruch, the son of Neriah, did as Jeremiah the prophet gave him orders to do, reading from the book the words of the Lord in the Lord's house.
Now it came about in the fifth year of Jehoiakim , the son of Josiah , king of Judah , in the ninth month , that it was given out publicly that all the people in Jerusalem , and all the people who came from the towns of Judah to
Jerusalem , were to keep from food before the Lord .
Then Baruch gave a public reading of the words of Jeremiah from the book , in the house of the Lord , in the room of Gemariah , the son of Shaphan the scribe , in the higher square , as one goes in by the new doorway of the
Lord ' s house , in the hearing of all the people .
And Micaiah, the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, after hearing all the words of the Lord from the book,
Went down to the king ' s house , to the scribe ' s room : and all the rulers were seated there , Elishama the scribe and Delaiah , the son of Shemaiah , and Elnathan , the son of Achbor , and Gemariah , the son of Shaphan
, and Zedekiah , the son of Hananiah , and all the rulers .
Then Micaiah gave them an account of all the words which had come to his ears when Baruch was reading the book to the people.
So all the rulers sent Jehudi , the son of Nethaniah , the son of Shelemiah , the son of Cushi , to Baruch , saying , Take in your hand the book from which you have been reading to the people and come . So Baruch , the son
of Neriah , took the book in his hand and came down to them .
Then they said to him, Be seated now, and give us a reading from it. So Baruch did so, reading it to them.
Now it came about that, after hearing all the words, they said to one another in fear, We will certainly give the king an account of all these words.
And questioning Baruch, they said, Say now, how did you put all these words down in writing from his mouth?
Then Baruch, answering, said, He said all these things to me by word of mouth, and I put them down with ink in the book.
Then the rulers said to Baruch, Go and put yourself in a safe place, you and Jeremiah, and let no man have knowledge of where you are.
Then they went into the open square to the king; but the book they put away in the room of Elishama the scribe; and they gave the king an account of all the words.
So the king sent Jehudi to get the book, and he took it from the room of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi gave a reading of it in the hearing of the king and all the rulers who were by the king's side.
Now the king was seated in the winter house, and a fire was burning in the fireplace in front of him.
And it came about that whenever Jehudi , in his reading , had got through three or four divisions , the king , cutting them with his penknife , put them into the fire , till all the book was burned up in the fire which was burning in the
fireplace .
But they had no fear and gave no signs of grief, not the king or any of his servants, after hearing all these words.
And Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made a strong request to the king not to let the book be burned, but he would not give ear to them.
And the king gave orders to Jerahmeel, the king's son, and Seraiah, the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah, the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the Lord kept them safe.
Then after the book, in which Baruch had put down the words of Jeremiah, had been burned by the king, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,
Take another book and put down in it all the words which were in the first book, which Jehoiakim, king of Judah, put into the fire.
And about Jehoiakim , king of Judah , you are to say , This is what the Lord has said : You have put this book into the fire , saying , Why have you put in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come , causing the destruction
of this land and putting an end to every man and beast in it ?
For this reason the Lord has said of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, He will have no son to take his place on the seat of David: his dead body will be put out to undergo the heat of the day and the cold of the night.
And I will send punishment on him and on his seed and on his servants for their evil-doing ; I will send on them and on the people of Jerusalem and the men of Judah , all the evil which I said against them , but they did not give
ear .
Then Jeremiah took another book , and gave it to Baruch the scribe , the son of Neriah , who put down in it , from the mouth of Jeremiah , all the words of the book which had been burned in the fire by Jehoiakim , king of Judah
: and in addition a number of other words of the same sort .
And Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, became king in place of Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, made king in the land of Judah.
But he and his servants and the people of the land did not give ear to the words of the Lord which he said by Jeremiah the prophet.
And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal, the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Make prayer now to the Lord our God for us.
(Now Jeremiah was going about among the people, for they had not put him in prison.
And Pharaoh's army had come out from Egypt: and the Chaldaeans, who were attacking Jerusalem, hearing news of them, went away from Jerusalem.)
Then the word of the Lord came to the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
The Lord , the God of Israel , has said : This is what you are to say to the king of Judah who sent you to get directions from me : See , Pharaoh ' s army , which has come out to your help , will go back
to Egypt , to their land .
And the Chaldaeans will come back again and make war against this town and they will take it and put it on fire.
The Lord has said, Have no false hopes, saying to yourselves, The Chaldaeans will go away from us: for they will not go away.
For even if you had overcome all the army of the Chaldaeans fighting against you, and there were only wounded men among them, still they would get up, every man in his tent, and put this town on fire.
And it came about that when the Chaldaean army outside Jerusalem had gone away for fear of Pharaoh's army,
Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, with the purpose of taking up his heritage there among the people.
But when he was at the Benjamin door , a captain of the watch named Irijah , the son of Shelemiah , the son of Hananiah , who was stationed there , put his hand on Jeremiah the prophet , saying , You are going to give yourself up to
the Chaldaeans .
Then Jeremiah said, That is not true; I am not going to the Chaldaeans. But he would not give ear to him: so Irijah made him prisoner and took him to the rulers.
And the rulers were angry with Jeremiah, and gave him blows and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.
So Jeremiah came into the hole of the prison, under the arches, and was there for a long time.
Then King Zedekiah sent and got him out : and the king , questioning him secretly in his house , said , Is there any word from the Lord ? And Jeremiah said , There is . Then he said , You will be given up into the hands of
the king of Babylon .
Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, What has been my sin against you or against your servants or against this people, that you have put me in prison?
Where now are your prophets who said to you, The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land?
And now be pleased to give ear, O my lord the king; let my prayer for help come before you, and do not make me go back to the house of Jonathan the scribe, for fear that I may come to my death there.
Then by the order of Zedekiah the king , Jeremiah was put into the place of the armed watchmen , and they gave him every day a cake of bread from the street of the bread-makers , till all the bread in the town was used up . So Jeremiah
was kept in the place of the armed watchmen .
Now it came to the ears of Shephatiah, the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah, the son of Pashhur, and Jucal, the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur, the son of Malchiah, that Jeremiah had said to all the people,
These are the words of the Lord : Whoever goes on living in this town will come to his death by the sword or through need of food or by disease : but whoever goes out to the Chaldaeans will keep his life out of the power of the attackers
and be safe .
The Lord has said, This town will certainly be given into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will take it.
Then the rulers said to the king , Let this man be put to death , because he is putting fear into the hearts of the men of war who are still in the town , and into the hearts of the people , by saying such things to them
: this man is not working for the well-being of the people , but for their damage .
Then Zedekiah the king said, See, he is in your hands: for the king was not able to do anything against them.
So they took Jeremiah and put him into the water-hole of Malchiah , the king ' s son , in the place of the armed watchmen : and they let Jeremiah down with cords . And in the hole there was no water , but wet earth : and Jeremiah
went down into the wet earth .
Now it came to the ears of Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, an unsexed servant in the king's house, that they had put Jeremiah into the water-hole; the king at that time being seated in the doorway of Benjamin:
And Ebed-melech went out from the king's house and said to the king,
My lord the king , these men have done evil in all they have done to Jeremiah the prophet , whom they have put into the water-hole ; and he will come to his death in the place where he is through need of food : for there is no
more bread in the town .
Then the king gave orders to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take with you three men from here and get Jeremiah out of the water-hole before death overtakes him.
So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went into the house of the king, to the place where the clothing was kept, and got from there old clothing and bits of old cloth, and let them down by cords into the water-hole where Jeremiah was.
And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Put these bits of old cloth under your arms under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.
So pulling Jeremiah up with the cords they got him out of the water-hole: and Jeremiah was kept in the place of the armed watchmen.
Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and took him into the rulers' doorway in the house of the Lord: and the king said to Jeremiah, I have a question to put to you; keep nothing back from me.
Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I give you the answer to your question, will you not certainly put me to death? and if I make a suggestion to you, you will not give it a hearing.
So King Zedekiah gave his oath to Jeremiah secretly, saying, By the living Lord, who gave us our life, I will not put you to death, or give you up to these men who are desiring to take your life.
Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah , These are the words of the Lord , the God of armies , the God of Israel : If you go out to the king of Babylon ' s captains , then you will have life , and the town will not be burned
with fire , and you and your family will be kept from death :
But if you do not go out to the king of Babylon's captains, then this town will be given into the hands of the Chaldaeans and they will put it on fire, and you will not get away from them.
And King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, I am troubled on account of the Jews who have gone over to the Chaldaeans, for fear that they may give me up to them and they will put me to shame.
But Jeremiah said, They will not give you up: be guided now by the word of the Lord as I have given it to you, and it will be well for you, and you will keep your life.
But if you do not go out, this is what the Lord has made clear to me:
See , all the rest of the women in the house of the king of Judah will be taken out to the king of Babylon ' s captains , and these women will say , Your nearest friends have been false to you and have got the better of you
: they have made your feet go deep into the wet earth , and they are turned away back from you .
And they will take all your wives and your children out to the Chaldaeans: and you will not get away out of their hands, but will be taken by the hands of the king of Babylon: and this town will be burned with fire.
Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, Let no man have knowledge of these words, and you will not be put to death.
But if it comes to the ears of the rulers that I have been talking with you , and they come and say to you , Give us word now of what you have said to the king and what the king said to you , keeping nothing back and
we will not put you to death ;
Then you are to say to them, I made my request to the king, that he would not send me back to my death in Jonathan's house.
Then all the rulers came to Jeremiah, questioning him: and he gave them an answer in the words the king had given him orders to say. So they said nothing more to him; for the thing was not made public.
So Jeremiah was kept in the place of the armed watchmen till the day when Jerusalem was taken.
And it came about, that when Jerusalem was taken, (in the ninth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, with all his army, came against Jerusalem, shutting it in on every side;
In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the town was broken into:)
All the captains of the king of Babylon came in and took their places in the middle doorway of the town, Nergal-shar-ezer, ruler of Sin-magir, the Rabmag, and Nebushazban, the Rab-saris, and all the captains of the king of Babylon.
And when Zedekiah , king of Judah , and all the men of war saw it , they went in flight from the town by night , by the way of the king ' s garden , through the doorway between the two walls : and they went out by
the Arabah .
But the Chaldaean army went after them and overtook Zedekiah in the lowlands of Jericho: and they made him a prisoner and took him up to Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, to Riblah in the land of Hamath, to be judged by him.
Then the king of Babylon put the sons of Zedekiah to death before his eyes in Riblah: and the king of Babylon put to death all the great men of Judah.
And more than this, he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and had him put in chains to take him away to Babylon.
And the Chaldaeans put the king's house on fire, as well as the houses of the people, and had the walls of Jerusalem broken down.
Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, took away to Babylon as prisoners, all the rest of the workmen who were still in the town, as well as those who had given themselves up to him, and all the rest of the people.
But Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, let the poorest of the people, who had nothing whatever, go on living in the land of Judah, and gave them vine-gardens and fields at the same time.
Now Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, gave orders about Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, saying,
Take him and keep an eye on him and see that no evil comes to him; but do with him whatever he says to you.
So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, sent Nebushazban, the Rab-saris, and Nergal-shar-ezer, the Rabmag, and all the chief captains of the king of Babylon,
And they sent and took Jeremiah out of the place of the watchmen, and gave him into the care of Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him to his house: so he was living among the people.
Now the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the place of the armed watchmen, saying,
Go and say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian , This is what the Lord of armies , the God of Israel , has said : See , my words will come true for this town , for evil and not for good : they will come about before your eyes on
that day .
But I will keep you safe on that day, says the Lord: you will not be given into the hands of the men you are fearing.
For I will certainly let you go free, and you will not be put to the sword, but your life will be given to you out of the hands of your attackers: because you have put your faith in me, says the Lord.
If you will come back, O Israel, says the Lord, you will come back to me: and if you will put away your disgusting ways, you will not be sent away from before me.
And you will take your oath, By the living Lord, in good faith and wisdom and righteousness; and the nations will make use of you as a blessing, and in you will they take a pride.
For this is what the Lord says to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem: Get your unworked land ploughed up, do not put in your seeds among thorns.
Undergo a circumcision of the heart, you men of Judah and people of Jerusalem: or my wrath may come out like fire, burning so that no one is able to put it out, because of the evil of your doings.
Say openly in Judah, give it out in Jerusalem, and say, Let the horn be sounded in the land: crying out in a loud voice, Come together, and let us go into the walled towns.
Put up a flag for a sign to Zion: go in flight so that you may be safe, waiting no longer: for I will send evil from the north, and a great destruction.
A lion has gone up from his secret place in the woods , and one who makes waste the nations is on his way ; he has gone out from his place , to make your land unpeopled , so that your towns will be made waste , with no
man living in them .
For this put on haircloth, with weeping and loud crying: for the burning wrath of the Lord is not turned back from us.
And it will come about in that day, says the Lord, that the heart of the king will be dead in him, and the hearts of the rulers; and the priests will be overcome with fear, and the prophets with wonder.
Then said I, Ah, Lord God! your words were not true when you said to this people and to Jerusalem, You will have peace; when the sword has come even to the soul.
At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A burning wind from the open hilltops in the waste land is blowing on the daughter of my people, not for separating or cleaning the grain;
A full wind will come for me: and now I will give my decision against them.
See, he will come up like the clouds, and his war-carriages like the storm-wind: his horses are quicker than eagles. Sorrow is ours, for destruction has come on us.
O Jerusalem, make your heart clean from evil, so that you may have salvation. How long are evil purposes to have a resting-place in you?
For a voice is sounding from Dan, giving out evil from the hills of Ephraim:
Make this come to the minds of the nations, make a statement openly against Jerusalem, that attackers are coming from a far country and their voices will be loud against the towns of Judah.
Like keepers of a field they are against her on every side; because she has been fighting against me, says the Lord.
Your ways and your doings have made these things come on you; this is your sin; truly it is bitter, going deep into your heart.
My soul, my soul! I am pained to my inmost heart; my heart is troubled in me; I am not able to be quiet, because the sound of the horn, the note of war, has come to my ears.
News is given of destruction on destruction; all the land is made waste: suddenly my tents, straight away my curtains, are made waste.
How long will I go on seeing the flag and hearing the sound of the war-horn?
For my people are foolish, they have no knowledge of me; they are evil-minded children, without sense, all of them: they are wise in evil-doing, but have no knowledge of doing good.
Looking at the earth, I saw that it was waste and without form; and to the heavens, that they had no light.
Looking at the mountains, I saw them shaking, and all the hills were moved about.
Looking, I saw that there was no man, and all the birds of heaven had gone in flight.
Looking, I saw that the fertile field was a waste, and all its towns were broken down before the Lord and before his burning wrath.
For this is what the Lord has said: All the land will become a waste; I will make destruction complete.
The earth will be weeping for this, and the heavens on high will be black: because I have said it, and I will not go back from it; it is my purpose, and it will not be changed.
All the land is in flight because of the noise of the horsemen and the bowmen; they have taken cover in the woodland and up on the rocks: every town has been given up, not a man is living in them.
And you , when you are made waste , what will you do ? Though you are clothed in red , though you make yourself beautiful with ornaments of gold , though you make your eyes wide with paint , it is for nothing that you make yourself fair ;
your lovers have no more desire for you , they have designs on your life .
A voice has come to my ears like the voice of a woman in birth-pains , the pain of one giving birth to her first child , the voice of the daughter of Zion , fighting for breath , stretching out her hands , saying , Now sorrow is mine
! for my strength is gone from me before the takers of life .
The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord , after Nebuzaradan , the captain of the armed men , had let him go from Ramah , when he had taken him ; for he had been put in chains , among all the prisoners of Jerusalem and Judah who
were taken away prisoners to Babylon .
And the captain of the armed men took Jeremiah and said to him, The Lord your God gave word of the evil which was to come on this place:
*** and the Lord has made it come, and has done as he said; because of your sin against the Lord in not giving ear to his voice; and that is why this thing has come on you.
Now see , this day I am freeing you from the chains which are on your hands . If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon , then come , and I will keep an eye on you ; but if it does not seem good
to you to come with me to Babylon , then do not come : see , all the land is before you ; if it seems good and right to you to go on living in the land ,
Then go back to Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , whom the king of Babylon has made ruler over the towns of Judah , and make your living-place with him among the people ; or go wherever it seems right to you to go
. So the captain of the armed men gave him food and some money and let him go .
So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, in Mizpah, and was living with him among the people who were still in the land.
Now when it came to the ears of all the captains of the forces who were in the field , and their men , that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam , ruler in the land , and had put under his care the
men and women and children , all the poorest of the land , those who had not been taken away to Babylon ;
Then they came to Gedaliah in Mizpah , even Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah , and Johanan , the son of Kareah , and Seraiah , the son of Tanhumeth , and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite , and Jezaniah , the son of the Maacathite , they
and their men .
And Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , took an oath to them and their men , saying , Have no fear of the servants of the Chaldaeans : go on living in the land , and become the servants of the king of Babylon
, and all will be well .
As for me , I will be living in Mizpah as your representative before the Chaldaeans who come to us : but you are to get in your wine and summer fruits and oil and put them in your vessels , and make living-places for yourselves in the towns which
you have taken .
In the same way , when all the Jews who were in Moab and among the children of Ammon and in Edom and in all the countries , had news that the king of Babylon had let Judah keep some of its people and that he had put over them
Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan ;
Then all the Jews came back from all the places to which they had gone in flight, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and got in a great store of wine and summer fruit.
Now Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces which were in the field, came to Gedaliah in Mizpah,
And said to him , Has it come to your knowledge that Baalis , the king of the children of Ammon , has sent Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah , to take your life ? But Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam , put no faith in what they
said .
Then Johanan , the son of Kareah , said to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly , Let me now go and put Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah , to death without anyone ' s knowledge : why let him take your life so that all the Jews who have come
together to you may be sent in flight , and the rest of the men of Judah come to an end ?
But Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, said to Johanan, the son of Kareah, You are not to do this: for what you say about Ishmael is false.
Now it came about in the seventh month that Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the king ' s seed , having with him ten men , came to Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam , in Mizpah ; and they had a
meal together in Mizpah .
Then Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah , and the ten men who were with him , got up , and attacking Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , with the sword , put to death him whom the king of Babylon had made ruler
over the land .
And Ishmael put to death all the Jews who were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldaean men of war.
Now on the second day after he had put Gedaliah to death, when no one had knowledge of it,
Some people came from Shechem , from Shiloh and Samaria , eighty men , with the hair of their faces cut off and their clothing out of order , and with cuts on their bodies , and in their hands meal offerings and perfumes which they were taking to the
house of the Lord .
And Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, went out from Mizpah with the purpose of meeting them, weeping on his way: and it came about that when he was face to face with them he said, Come to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam.
And when they came inside the town, Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, and the men who were with him, put them to death and put their bodies into a deep hole.
But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, Do not put us to death, for we have secret stores, in the country, of grain and oil and honey. So he did not put them to death with their countrymen.
Now the hole into which Ishmael had put the dead bodies of the men whom he had put to death , was the great hole which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha , king of Israel : and Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah , made it
full of the bodies of those who had been put to death .
Then Ishmael took away as prisoners all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah , the king ' s daughters and all the people still in Mizpah , whom Nebuzaradan , the captain of the armed men , had put under the care of Gedaliah , the son
of Ahikam : Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah , took them away prisoners with the purpose of going over to the children of Ammon .
But when Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the armed forces who were with him, had news of all the evil which Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, had done,
They took their men and went out to make war on Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, and they came face to face with him by the great waters in Gibeon.
Now when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces with him, then they were glad.
And all the people whom Ishmael had taken away prisoners from Mizpah, turning round, came back and went to Johanan, the son of Kareah.
But Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, got away from Johanan, with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon.
Then Johanan , the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , took all the rest of the people whom Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah , had made prisoners , after he had put to death Gedaliah , the son of
Ahikam , the people from Mizpah , that is , the men of war and the women and the children and the unsexed servants , whom he had taken back with him from Gibeon :
And they went and were living in the resting-place of Chimham, which is near Beth-lehem on the way into Egypt,
Because of the Chaldaeans: for they were in fear of them because Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, had put to death Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had made ruler over the land.
Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan, the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah, the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest, came near,
And said to Jeremiah the prophet , Let our request come before you , and make prayer for us to the Lord your God , even for this small band of us ; for we are only a small band out of what was a great number , as your
eyes may see :
That the Lord your God may make clear to us the way in which we are to go and what we are to do.
Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them , I have given ear to you ; see , I will make prayer to the Lord your God , as you have said ; and it will be that , whatever the Lord may say in answer to you , I will
give you word of it , keeping nothing back .
Then they said to Jeremiah, May the Lord be a true witness against us in good faith, if we do not do everything which the Lord your God sends you to say to us.
If it is good or if it is evil , we will be guided by the voice of the Lord our God , to whom we are sending you ; so that it may be well for us when we give ear to the voice of the Lord our God
And it came about that after ten days the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah.
And he sent for Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were still with him, and all the people, from the least to the greatest,
And said to them, These are the words of the Lord, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to put your request before him:
If you still go on living in the land, then I will go on building you up and not pulling you down, planting you and not uprooting you: for my purpose of doing evil to you has been changed.
Have no fear of the king of Babylon, of whom you are now in fear; have no fear of him, says the Lord: for I am with you to keep you safe and to give you salvation from his hands.
And I will have mercy on you, so that he may have mercy on you and let you go back to your land.
But if you say, We have no desire to go on living in this land; and do not give ear to the voice of the Lord your God,
Saying, No, but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we will not see war, or be hearing the sound of the horn, or be in need of food; there we will make our living-place;
Then give ear now to the word of the Lord, O you last of Judah: the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said, If your minds are fixed on going into Egypt and stopping there;
Then it will come about that the sword , which is the cause of your fear , will overtake you there in the land of Egypt , and need of food , which you are fearing , will go after you there in Egypt ; and there death will come
to you .
Such will be the fate of all the men whose minds are fixed on going into Egypt and stopping there ; they will come to their end by the sword , by being short of food , and by disease : not one of them will keep his life or
get away from the evil which I will send on them .
For this is what the Lord of armies , the God of Israel , has said : As my wrath and passion have been let loose on the people of Jerusalem , so will my passion be let loose on you when you go into Egypt : and you will
become an oath and a cause of wonder and a curse and a name of shame ; and you will never see this place again .
The Lord has said about you, O last of Judah, Go not into Egypt: be certain that I have given witness to you this day.
For you have been acting with deceit in your hearts; for you sent me to the Lord your God, saying, Make prayer for us to the Lord our God, and give us word of everything he may say, and we will do it.
And this day I have made it clear to you, and you have not given ear to the voice of the Lord your God in anything for which he has sent me to you.
And now be certain that you will come to your end by the sword and by being short of food and by disease, in the place to which you are pleased to go for a living-place.
And it came about that when Jeremiah had come to the end of giving all the people the words of the Lord their God, which the Lord their God had sent him to say to them, even all these words,
Then Azariah , the son of Hoshaiah , and Johanan , the son of Kareah , and all the men of pride , said to Jeremiah , You have said what is false : the Lord our God has not sent you to say , You are not to go
into the land of Egypt and make your living-place there :
But Baruch, the son of Neriah, is moving you against us, to give us up into the hands of the Chaldaeans so that they may put us to death, and take us away prisoners into Babylon.
So Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, did not give ear to the order of the Lord that they were to go on living in the land of Judah.
But Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces took all the rest of Judah who had come back into the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been forced to go;
The men and the women and the children and the king ' s daughters , and every person whom Nebuzaradan , the captain of the armed men , had put under the care of Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , and Jeremiah the prophet
and Baruch , the son of Neriah ;
And they came into the land of Egypt; for they did not give ear to the voice of the Lord: and they came to Tahpanhes.
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,
Take in your hand some great stones, and put them in a safe place in the paste in the brickwork which is at the way into Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, before the eyes of the men of Judah;
And say to them , This is what the Lord of armies , the God of Israel , has said : See , I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar , the king of Babylon , my servant , and he will put the seat of his kingdom on these stones
which have been put in a safe place here by you ; and his tent will be stretched over them .
And he will come and overcome the land of Egypt; those who are for death will be put to death, those who are to be prisoners will be made prisoners, and those who are for the sword will be given to the sword.
And he will put a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and they will be burned by him: and he will make Egypt clean as a keeper of sheep makes clean his clothing; and he will go out from there in peace.
And the stone pillars of Beth-shemesh in the land of Egypt will be broken by him, and the houses of the gods of Egypt burned with fire.
The word which came to Jeremiah about all the Jews who were living in the land of Egypt, in Migdol and at Tahpanhes and at Noph and in the country of Pathros, saying,
The Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: You have seen all the evil which I have sent on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah; and now, this day they are waste and unpeopled;
Because of the evil which they have done, moving me to wrath by burning perfumes in worship to other gods, who were not their gods or yours or the gods of their fathers.
And I sent all my servants the prophets to you, getting up early and sending them, saying, Do not do this disgusting thing which is hated by me.
But they gave no attention, and their ears were not open so that they might be turned from their evil-doing and from burning perfume to other gods.
Because of this, my passion and my wrath were let loose, burning in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are waste and unpeopled as at this day.
So now , the Lord , the God of armies , the God of Israel , has said , Why are you doing this great evil against yourselves , causing every man and woman , little child and baby at the breast among you in Judah to be cut off
till not one is still living ;
Moving me to wrath with the work of your hands , burning perfumes to other gods in the land of Egypt , where you have gone to make a place for yourselves , so that you may become a curse and a name of shame among all the nations of
the earth ?
Have you no memory of the evil-doing of your fathers , and the evil-doing of the kings of Judah , and the evil-doing of their wives , and the evil which you yourselves have done , and the evil which your wives have done , in the land of Judah
and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
Even to this day their hearts are not broken, and they have no fear, and have not gone in the way of my law or of my rules which I gave to you and to your fathers.
So this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: See, my face will be turned against you for evil, for the cutting off of all Judah;
And I will take the last of Judah , whose minds are fixed on going into the land of Egypt and stopping there , and they will all come to their end , falling in the land of Egypt by the sword and by being short of food and by
disease ; death will overtake them , from the least to the greatest , death by the sword and by need of food : they will become an oath and a cause of wonder and a curse and a name of shame .
For I will send punishment on those who are living in the land of Egypt, as I have sent punishment on Jerusalem, by the sword and by need of food and by disease:
So that not one of the rest of Judah , who have gone into the land of Egypt and are living there , will get away or keep his life , to come back to the land of Judah where they are hoping to come back and be living again
: for not one will come back , but only those who are able to get away .
Then all the men who had knowledge that their wives were burning perfumes to other gods, and all the women who were present, a great meeting, answering Jeremiah, said,
As for the word which you have said to us in the name of the Lord, we will not give ear to you.
But we will certainly do every word which has gone out of our mouths , burning perfumes to the queen of heaven and draining out drink offerings to her as we did , we and our fathers and our kings and our rulers , in the towns of Judah and
in the streets of Jerusalem : for then we had food enough and did well and saw no evil .
But from the time when we gave up burning perfumes to the queen of heaven and draining out drink offerings to her, we have been in need of all things, and have been wasted by the sword and by need of food.
And the women said, When we were burning perfumes to the queen of heaven and draining out drink offerings to her, did we make cakes in her image and give her our drink offerings without the knowledge of our husbands?
Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and women and all the people who had given him that answer,
The perfumes which you have been burning in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem , you and your fathers and your kings and your rulers and the people of the land , had the Lord no memory of them , and did he not keep them
in mind ?
And the Lord was no longer able to put up with the evil of your doings and the disgusting things you did ; and because of this your land has become a waste and a cause of wonder and a curse , with no one living in it , as
at this day .
Because you have been burning perfumes , and sinning against the Lord , and have not given ear to the voice of the Lord , or gone in the way of his law or his rules or his orders ; for this reason this evil has come on you ,
as it is today .
Further, Jeremiah said to all the people and all the women, Give ear to the word of the Lord, all those of Judah who are living in Egypt:
This is what the Lord of armies , the God of Israel , has said : You women have said with your mouths , and with your hands you have done what you said , We will certainly give effect to the oaths we have made , to have perfumes
burned to the queen of heaven and drink offerings drained out to her : then give effect to your oaths and do them .
And now give ear to the word of the Lord , all you of Judah who are living in the land of Egypt : Truly , I have taken an oath by my great name , says the Lord , that my name is no longer to be named in
the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt , saying , By the life of the Lord God .
See, I am watching over them for evil and not for good: all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will be wasted by the sword and by need of food till there is an end of them.
And those who get away safe from the sword will come back from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah , a very small number ; and all the rest of Judah , who have gone into the land of Egypt and are living there , will see
whose word has effect , mine or theirs .
And this will be the sign to you, says the Lord, that I will give you punishment in this place, so that you may see that my words will certainly have effect against you for evil:
The Lord has said , See , I will give up Pharaoh Hophra , king of Egypt , into the hands of those who are fighting against him and desiring to take his life , as I gave Zedekiah , king of Judah , into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar ,
king of Babylon , his hater , who had designs against his life .
The words which Jeremiah the prophet said to Baruch, the son of Neriah, when he put these words down in a book from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah; he said,
This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, has said of you, O Baruch:
You said, Sorrow is mine! for the Lord has given me sorrow in addition to my pain; I am tired with the sound of my sorrow, and I get no rest.
This is what you are to say to him: The Lord has said, Truly, the building which I put up will be broken down, and that which was planted by me will be uprooted, and this through all the land;
And as for you, are you looking for great things for yourself? Have no desire for them: for truly I will send evil on all flesh, says the Lord: but your life I will keep safe from attack wherever you go.
The word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah the prophet about the nations.
Of Egypt: about the army of Pharaoh-neco, king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, overcame in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah.
Get out the breastplate and body-cover, and come together to the fight.
Make the horses ready, and get up, you horsemen, and take your places with your head-dresses; make the spears sharp and put on the breastplates.
What have I seen? they are overcome with fear and turned back; their men of war are broken and have gone in flight, not looking back: fear is on every side, says the Lord.
Let not the quick-footed go in flight, or the man of war get away; on the north, by the river Euphrates, they are slipping and falling.
Who is this coming up like the Nile, whose waters are lifting their heads like the rivers?
Egypt is coming up like the Nile, and his waters are lifting their heads like the rivers, and he says, I will go up, covering the earth; I will send destruction on the town and its people.
Go up, you horses; go rushing on, you carriages of war; go out, you men of war: Cush and Put, gripping the body-cover, and the Ludim, with bent bows.
But that day is the day of the Lord , the Lord of armies , a day of punishment when he will take payment from his haters : and the sword will have all its desire , drinking their blood in full measure : for there is an offering to
the Lord , the Lord of armies , in the north country by the river Euphrates .
Go up to Gilead and take sweet oil, O virgin daughter of Egypt: there is no help in all your medical arts; nothing will make you well.
Your shame has come to the ears of the nations, and the earth is full of your cry: for the strong man is falling against the strong, they have come down together.
The word which the Lord said to Jeremiah the prophet, of how Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, would come and make war on the land of Egypt.
Give the news in Migdol, make it public in Noph: say, Take up your positions and make yourselves ready; for on every side of you the sword has made destruction.
Why has Apis, your strong one, gone in flight? he was not able to keep his place, because the Lord was forcing him down with strength.
... are stopped in their going, they are falling; and they say one to another, Let us get up and go back to our people, to the land of our birth, away from the cruel sword.
Give a name to Pharaoh, king of Egypt: A noise who has let the time go by.
By my life, says the King, whose name is the Lord of armies, truly, like Tabor among the mountains and like Carmel by the sea, so will he come.
O daughter living in Egypt, make ready the vessels of a prisoner: for Noph will become a waste, it will be burned up and become unpeopled.
Egypt is a fair young cow; but a biting insect has come on her out of the north.
And those who were her fighters for payment are like fat oxen; for they are turned back, they have gone in flight together, they do not keep their place: for the day of their fate has come on them, the time of their punishment.
She makes a sound like the hiss of a snake when they come on with strength; they go against her with axes, like wood-cutters.
They will be cutting down her woods, for they may not be searched out; because they are like locusts, more than may be numbered.
The daughter of Egypt will be put to shame; she will be given up into the hands of the people of the north.
The Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: See, I will send punishment on Amon of No and on Pharaoh and on those who put their faith in him;
And I will give them up into the hands of those who will take their lives , and into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar , king of Babylon , and into the hands of his servants : and later , it will be peopled as in the past , says the
Lord .
But have no fear , O Jacob , my servant , and do not be troubled , O Israel : for see , I will make you come back from far away , and your seed from the land where they are prisoners ; and Jacob will come back ,
and will be quiet and in peace , and no one will give him cause for fear .
Have no fear , O Jacob , my servant , says the Lord ; for I am with you : for I will put an end to all the nations where I have sent you , but I will not put an end to you completely : though with wise
purpose I will put right your errors , and will not let you go quite without punishment .
The word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah the prophet about the Philistines, before Pharaoh's attack on Gaza.
This is what the Lord has said : See , waters are coming up out of the north , and will become an overflowing stream , overflowing the land and everything in it , the town and those who are living in it ; and men will give a cry
, and all the people of the land will be crying out in pain .
At the noise of the stamping of the feet of his war-horses, at the rushing of his carriages and the thunder of his wheels, fathers will give no thought to their children, because their hands are feeble;
Because of the day which is coming with destruction on all the Philistines, cutting off from Tyre and Zidon the last of their helpers: for the Lord will send destruction on the Philistines, the rest of the sea-land of Caphtor.
The hair is cut off from the head of Gaza; Ashkelon has come to nothing; the last of the Anakim are deeply wounding themselves.
O sword of the Lord, how long will you have no rest? put yourself back into your cover; be at peace, be quiet.
How is it possible for it to be quiet, seeing that the Lord has given it orders? against Ashkelon and against the sea-land he has given it directions.
Of Moab. The Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: Sorrow on Nebo, for it has been made waste; Kiriathaim has been put to shame and is taken: the strong place is put to shame and broken down.
The praise of Moab has come to an end ; as for Heshbon , evil has been designed against her ; come , let us put an end to her as a nation . But your mouth will be shut , O Madmen ; the sword will go after you
There is the sound of crying from Horonaim, wasting and great destruction;
Moab is broken; her cry has gone out to Zoar.
For by the slope of Luhith they will go up, weeping all the way; for on the way down to Horonaim the cry of destruction has come to their ears.
Go in flight, get away with your lives, and let your faces be turned to Aroer in the Arabah.
For because you have put your faith in your strong places, you, even you, will be taken: and Chemosh will go out as a prisoner, his priests and his rulers together.
And the attacker will come against every town, not one will be safe; and the valley will be made waste, and destruction will come to the lowland, as the Lord has said.
Put up a pillar for Moab, for she will come to a complete end: and her towns will become a waste, without anyone living in them.
Let him be cursed who does the Lord's work half-heartedly; let him be cursed who keeps back his sword from blood.
From his earliest days, Moab has been living in comfort; like wine long stored he has not been drained from vessel to vessel, he has never gone away as a prisoner: so his taste is still in him, his smell is unchanged.
So truly, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will send to him men who will have him turned over till there is no more wine in his vessels, and his wine-skins will be completely broken.
And Moab will be shamed on account of Chemosh, as the children of Israel were shamed on account of Beth-el their hope.
How say you, We are men of war and strong fighters?
He who makes Moab waste has gone up against her; and the best of her young men have gone down to their death, says the King, whose name is the Lord of armies.
The fate of Moab is near, and trouble is coming on him very quickly.
All you who are round about him, give signs of grief for him, and all you who have knowledge of his name, say, How is the strong rod broken, even the beautiful branch!
Come down from your glory, O people of Dibon, and take your seat in the place of the waste; for the attacker of Moab has gone up against you, sending destruction on your strong places.
O daughter of Aroer, take your station by the way, on the watch: questioning him who is in flight, and her who has got away safe, say, What has been done?
Moab has been put to shame, she is broken: make loud sounds of grief, crying out for help; give the news in Arnon, that Moab has been made waste.
And punishment has come on the lowlands; on Holon and Jahzah, and on Mephaath,
And on Dibon, and on Nebo, and on Beth-diblathaim,
And on Kiriathaim, and on Beth-gamul, and on Beth-meon,
And on Kerioth, and on Bozrah, and on all the towns of the land of Moab, far and near.
The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, says the Lord.
Make him full of wine, for his heart has been lifted up against the Lord: and Moab will be rolling in the food he was not able to keep down, and everyone will be making sport of him.
For did you not make sport of Israel? was he taken among thieves? for whenever you were talking about him, you were shaking your head over him.
O people of Moab, go away from the towns and take cover in the rock; be like the dove of the Arabah, which makes her living-place in holes.
We have had word of the pride of Moab, how great it is; how he is lifted up in pride; and his great opinion of himself, and that his heart is lifted up.
I have knowledge of his wrath, says the Lord, that it is nothing; his high-sounding words have done nothing.
For this cause I will give cries of grief for Moab, crying out for Moab, even for all of it; I will be sorrowing for the men of Kir-heres.
My weeping for you, O vine of Sibmah, will be more than the weeping of Jazer: your branches have gone over the sea, stretching even to Jazer: destruction has come down on your summer fruits and your cut grapes.
All joy is gone; no longer are they glad for the fertile field and for the land of Moab; I have made the wine come to an end from the crushing vessels: no longer will the grapes be crushed with the sound of glad voices.
The cry of Heshbon comes even to Elealeh; to Jahaz their voice is sounding; from Zoar even to Horonaim and to Eglath-shelishiyah: for the waters of Nimrim will become dry.
And I will put an end in Moab, says the Lord, to him who is making offerings in the high place and burning perfumes to his gods.
So my heart is sounding for Moab like the sound of pipes, and my heart is sounding like pipes for the men of Kir-heres: for the wealth he has got for himself has come to an end.
For everywhere the hair of the head and the hair of the face is cut off: on every hand there are wounds, and haircloth on every body.
On all the house-tops of Moab and in its streets there is weeping everywhere; for Moab has been broken like a vessel in which there is no pleasure, says the Lord.
How is it broken down! how is Moab's back turned in shame! so Moab will be a cause of sport and of fear to everyone round about him.
For the Lord has said, See, he will come like an eagle in flight, stretching out his wings against Moab.
Kerioth is taken, and the strong places have been forced, and the hearts of Moab's men of war in that day will be like the heart of a woman in birth-pains.
And Moab will come to an end as a people, because he has been lifting himself up against the Lord.
Fear and death and the net have come on you, O people of Moab, says the Lord.
He who goes in flight from the fear will be overtaken by death; and he who gets free from death will be taken in the net: for I will make this come on Moab, even the year of their punishment, says the Lord.
Those who went in flight from the fear are waiting under the shade of Heshbon: for a fire has gone out from Heshbon and a flame from the house of Sihon, burning up the pride of Moab and the crown of the head of the violent ones.
Sorrow is yours, O Moab! the people of Chemosh are overcome: for your sons have been taken away as prisoners, and your daughters made servants.
But still, I will let the fate of Moab be changed in the last days, says the Lord.
About the children of Ammon. These are the words of the Lord: Has Israel no sons? has he no one to take the heritage? why then has Milcom taken Gad for himself, putting his people in its towns?
Because of this , see , the days are coming when I will have a cry of war sounded against Rabbah , the town of the children of Ammon ; it will become a waste of broken walls , and her daughter-towns will be burned with fire : then Israel
will take the heritage of those who took his heritage , says the Lord .
Make sounds of grief , O Heshbon , for Ai is wasted ; give loud cries , O daughters of Rabbah , and put haircloth round you : give yourselves to weeping , running here and there and wounding yourselves ; for Milcom will be taken prisoner together with his
rulers and his priests .
Why are you lifted up in pride on account of your valleys, your flowing valley, O daughter ever turning away? who puts her faith in her wealth, saying, Who will come against me?
See , I will send fear on you , says the Lord , the Lord of armies , from those who are round you on every side ; you will be forced out , every man straight before him , and there will be no one to get together the
wanderers .
But after these things, I will let the fate of the children of Ammon be changed, says the Lord.
About Edom. This is what the Lord of armies has said. Is there no more wisdom in Teman? have wise suggestions come to an end among men of good sense? has their wisdom completely gone?
Go in flight, go back, take cover in deep places, you who are living in Dedan; for I will send the fate of Edom on him, even the time of his punishment.
If men came to get your grapes, would they not let some be uncut on the vines? if thieves came by night, would they not make waste till they had enough?
I have had Esau searched out, uncovering his secret places, so that he may not keep himself covered: his seed is wasted and has come to an end, and there is no help from his neighbours.
Put in my care your children who have no father, and I will keep them safe; and let your widows put their faith in me.
For the Lord has said, Those for whom the cup was not made ready will certainly be forced to take of it; and are you to go without punishment? you will not be without punishment, but will certainly be forced to take from the cup.
For I have taken an oath by myself, says the Lord, that Bozrah will become a cause of wonder, a name of shame, a waste and a curse; and all its towns will be waste places for ever.
Word has come to me from the Lord, and a representative has been sent to the nations, to say, Come together and go up against her, and take your places for the fight.
For see, I have made you small among the nations, looked down on by men.
. . . the pride of your heart has been a false hope , O you who are living in the cracks of the rock , keeping your place on the top of the hill : even if you made your living-place as high as the eagle , I would
make you come down , says the Lord .
And Edom will become a cause of wonder: everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder, and make sounds of fear at all her punishments.
As at the downfall of Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbouring towns, says the Lord, no man will be living in it, no son of man will have a resting-place there.
See , he will come up like a lion from the thick growth of Jordan against the resting-place of Teman : but I will suddenly make him go in flight from her ; and I will put over her the man of my selection : for who is like me
? and who will put forward his cause against me ? and what keeper of sheep will be able to keep his place before me ?
For this cause give ear to the decision of the Lord which he has made against Edom , and to his purposes designed against the people of Teman : Truly , they will be pulled away by the smallest of the flock ; truly , he will make waste their
fields with them .
The earth is shaking with the noise of their fall; their cry is sounding in the Red Sea.
See, he will come up like an eagle in flight, stretching out his wings against Bozrah: and the hearts of Edom's men of war on that day will be like the heart of a woman in birth-pains.
About Damascus. Hamath is put to shame, and Arpad; for the word of evil has come to their ears, their heart in its fear is turned to water, it will not be quiet.
Damascus has become feeble, she is turned to flight, fear has taken her in its grip: pain and sorrows have come on her, as on a woman in birth-pains.
How has the town of praise been wasted, the place of joy!
So her young men will be falling in her streets, and all the men of war will be cut off in that day, says the Lord of armies.
And I will have a fire lighted on the wall of Damascus, burning up the great houses of Ben-hadad.
About Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, overcame. This is what the Lord has said: Up! go against Kedar, and make an attack on the children of the east.
Their tents and their flocks they will take; they will take away for themselves their curtains and all their vessels and their camels: they will give a cry to them, Fear on every side.
Go in flight, go wandering far off, take cover in deep places, O people of Hazor, says the Lord; for Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, has made a design against you, he has a purpose against you in mind.
Up! go against a nation which is living in comfort and without fear of danger, says the Lord, without doors or locks, living by themselves.
And their camels will be taken from them by force , and their great herds will come into the hands of their attackers : those who have the ends of their hair cut I will send in flight to all the winds ; and I will send their fate on
them from every side , says the Lord .
And Hazor will be a hole for jackals, a waste for ever: no one will be living in it, and no son of man will have a resting-place there.
The word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah the prophet about Elam, when Zedekiah first became king of Judah, saying,
This is what the Lord of armies has said: See, I will have the bow of Elam, their chief strength, broken.
And I will send on Elam four winds from the four quarters of heaven, driving them out to all those winds; there will be no nation into which the wanderers from Elam do not come.
And I will let Elam be broken before their haters , and before those who are making designs against their lives : I will send evil on them , even my burning wrath , says the Lord ; and I will send the sword after them till I have put
an end to them :
I will put the seat of my power in Elam, and in Elam I will put an end to kings and rulers, says the Lord.
But it will come about that, in the last days, I will let the fate of Elam be changed, says the Lord.
Go quickly through the streets of Jerusalem , and see now , and get knowledge , and make a search in her wide places if there is a man , if there is one in her who is upright , who keeps faith ; and she will have my forgiveness
And though they say, By the living Lord; truly their oaths are false.
O Lord , do not your eyes see good faith ? you have given them punishment , but they were not troubled ; you have sent destruction on them , but they did not take your teaching to heart : they have made their faces harder than a rock ;
they would not come back .
Then I said, But these are the poor: they are foolish, for they have no knowledge of the way of the Lord or of the behaviour desired by their God.
I will go to the great men and have talk with them; for they have knowledge of the way of the Lord and of the behaviour desired by their God. But as for these, their one purpose is a broken yoke and burst bands.
And so a lion from the woods will put them to death , a wolf of the waste land will make them waste , a leopard will keep watch on their towns , and everyone who goes out from them will be food for the beasts ; because of the
great number of their sins and the increase of their wrongdoing .
How is it possible for you to have my forgiveness for this ? your children have given me up , taking their oaths by those who are no gods : when I had given them food in full measure , they were false to their wives , taking their pleasure
in the houses of loose women .
They were full of desire, like horses after a meal of grain: everyone went after his neighbour's wife.
Am I not to give punishment for these things? says the Lord: will not my soul take payment from such a nation as this?
Go up against her vines and make waste; let the destruction be complete: take away her branches, for they are not the Lord's.
For the people of Israel and the people of Judah have been very false to me, says the Lord.
They would have nothing to do with the Lord, saying, He will do nothing, and no evil will come to us; we will not see the sword or be short of food:
And the prophets will become wind, and the word is not in them; so it will be done to them.
For this reason the Lord, the God of armies, has said: Because you have said this, I will make my words in your mouth a fire, and this people wood, and they will be burned up by it.
See, I will send you a nation from far away, O people of Israel, says the Lord; a strong nation and an old nation, a nation whose language is strange to you, so that you may not get the sense of their words.
Their arrows give certain death, they are all men of war.
They will take all the produce of your fields , which would have been food for your sons and your daughters : they will take your flocks and your herds : they will take all your vines and your fig-trees : and with the sword they will make waste your
walled towns in which you put your faith .
But even in those days, says the Lord, I will not let your destruction be complete.
And it will come about , when you say , Why has the Lord our God done all these things to us ? that you will say to them , As you gave me up , making yourselves servants to strange gods in your land , so will you be
servants to strange men in a land which is not yours .
Say this openly in Jacob and give it out in Judah, saying,
Give ear now to this, O foolish people without sense; who have eyes but see nothing, and ears without the power of hearing:
Have you no fear of me ? says the Lord ; will you not be shaking with fear before me , who have put the sand as a limit for the sea , by an eternal order , so that it may not go past it ? and though it
is ever in motion , it is not able to have its way ; though the sound of its waves is loud , they are not able to go past it .
But the heart of this people is uncontrolled and turned away from me; they are broken loose and gone.
And they do not say in their hearts, Now let us give worship to our God, who gives the rain, the winter and the spring rain, at the right time; who keeps for us the ordered weeks of the grain-cutting.
Through your evil-doing these things have been turned away, and your sins have kept back good from you.
For there are sinners among my people: they keep watch, like men watching for birds; they put a net and take men in it.
As the fowl-house is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: for this reason they have become great and have got wealth.
They have become fat and strong: they have gone far in works of evil: they give no support to the cause of the child without a father, so that they may do well; they do not see that the poor man gets his rights.
Am I not to give punishment for these things? says the Lord: will not my soul take payment from such a nation as this?
A thing of wonder and fear has come about in the land;
The prophets give false words and the priests give decisions by their direction; and my people are glad to have it so: and what will you do in the end?
The word which the Lord said about Babylon, about the land of the Chaldaeans, by Jeremiah the prophet.
Give it out among the nations , make it public , and let the flag be lifted up ; give the word and keep nothing back ; say , Babylon is taken , Bel is put to shame , Merodach is broken , her images are put to shame ,
her gods are broken .
For out of the north a nation is coming up against her, which will make her land waste and unpeopled: they are in flight, man and beast are gone.
In those days and in that time, says the Lord, the children of Israel will come, they and the children of Judah together; they will go on their way weeping and making prayer to the Lord their God.
They will be questioning about the way to Zion, with their faces turned in its direction, saying, Come, and be united to the Lord in an eternal agreement which will be kept in mind for ever.
My people have been wandering sheep: their keepers have made them go out of the right way, turning them loose on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, having no memory of their resting-place.
They have been attacked by all those who came across them: and their attackers said, We are doing no wrong, because they have done evil against the Lord in whom is righteousness, against the Lord, the hope of their fathers.
Go in flight out of Babylon, go out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and be like he-goats before the flocks.
For see , I am moving and sending up against Babylon a band of great nations from the north country : and they will put their armies in position against her ; and from there she will be taken : their arrows will be like those of an expert man
of war ; not one will come back without getting its mark .
And the wealth of Chaldaea will come into the hands of her attackers: all those who take her wealth will have enough, says the Lord.
Because you are glad, because you are lifted up with pride, you wasters of my heritage, because you are playing like a young cow put out to grass, and you make a noise like strong horses;
Your mother will be put to shame; she who gave you birth will be looked down on: see, she will be the last of the nations, a waste place, a dry and unwatered land.
Because of the wrath of the Lord no one will be living in it, and it will be quite unpeopled: everyone who goes by Babylon will be overcome with wonder, and make sounds of fear at all her punishments.
Put your armies in position against Babylon on every side, all you bowmen; let loose your arrows at her, not keeping any back: for she has done evil against the Lord.
Give a loud cry against her on every side ; she has given herself up , her supports are overturned , her walls are broken down : for it is the payment taken by the Lord ; give her payment ; as she has done , so do to her
Let the planter of seed be cut off from Babylon, and everyone using the curved blade at the time of the grain-cutting: for fear of the cruel sword, everyone will be turned to his people, everyone will go in flight to his land.
Israel is a wandering sheep; the lions have been driving him away: first he was attacked by the king of Assyria, and now his bones have been broken by Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon.
So this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: See, I will send punishment on the king of Babylon and on his land, as I have given punishment to the king of Assyria.
And I will make Israel come back to his resting-place, and he will get his food on Carmel and Bashan, and have his desire in full measure on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.
In those days and in that time, says the Lord, when the evil-doing of Israel is looked for, there will be nothing; and in Judah no sins will be seen: for I will have forgiveness for those whom I will keep safe.
Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the people of Pekod; put them to death and send destruction after them, says the Lord, and do everything I have given you orders to do.
There is a sound of war in the land and of great destruction.
How is the hammer of all the earth cut in two and broken! how has Babylon become a waste among the nations!
I have put a net for you, and you have been taken, O Babylon, without your knowledge: you have been uncovered and taken because you were fighting against the Lord.
From his store-house the Lord has taken the instruments of his wrath: for the Lord, the Lord of armies, has a work to do in the land of the Chaldaeans.
Come up against her one and all, let her store-houses be broken open: make her into a mass of stones, give her to the curse, till there is nothing of her to be seen.
Put all her oxen to the sword; let them go down to death: sorrow is theirs, for their day has come, the time of their punishment.
The voice of those who are in flight, who have got away safe from the land of Babylon, to give news in Zion of punishment from the Lord our God, even payment for his Temple.
Send for the archers to come together against Babylon , all the bowmen ; put up your tents against her on every side ; let no one get away : give her the reward of her work ; as she has done , so do to her : for she
has been uplifted in pride against the Lord , against the Holy One of Israel .
For this cause her young men will be falling in her streets, and all her men of war will be cut off in that day, says the Lord.
See, I am against you, O pride, says the Lord, the Lord of armies, for your day has come, the time when I will send punishment on you.
And pride will go with uncertain steps and have a fall, and there will be no one to come to his help: and I will put a fire in his towns, burning up everything round about him.
This is what the Lord of armies has said: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are crushed down together: all those who took them prisoner keep them in a tight grip; they will not let them go.
Their saviour is strong; the Lord of armies is his name: he will certainly take up their cause, so that he may give rest to the earth and trouble to the people of Babylon.
A sword is on the Chaldaeans, says the Lord, and on the people of Babylon, and on her rulers and on her wise men.
A sword is on the men of pride, and they will become foolish: a sword is on her men of war, and they will be broken.
A sword is on all the mixed people in her, and they will become like women: a sword is on her store-houses, and they will be taken by her attackers.
A sword is on her waters, drying them up; for it is a land of images, and their minds are fixed on false gods.
For this reason the beasts of the waste land with the wolves will make their holes there and the ostriches will be living in it: never again will men be living there, it will be unpeopled from generation to generation.
As when Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbouring towns were overturned by God, says the Lord, so no man will be living in it, and no son of man will have a resting-place there.
See, a people is coming from the north; a great nation and a number of kings will be put in motion from the inmost parts of the earth.
Bows and spears are in their hands ; they are cruel and have no mercy ; their voice is like the thunder of the sea , and they go on horses ; everyone in his place like men going to the fight , against you , O daughter of Babylon
The king of Babylon has had news of them, and his hands have become feeble: trouble has come on him and pain like the pain of a woman in childbirth.
See , he will come up like a lion from the thick growth of Jordan against the resting-place of Teman : but I will suddenly make them go in flight from her ; and I will put over her the man of my selection : for who is like me
? and who will put forward his cause against me ? and what keeper of sheep will keep his place before me ?
So give ear to the decision of the Lord which he has made against Babylon , and to his purposes designed against the land of the Chaldaeans ; Truly , they will be pulled away by the smallest of the flock ; truly , he will make waste their fields
with them .
At the cry, Babylon is taken! the earth is shaking, and the cry comes to the ears of the nations.
The Lord has said: See, I will make a wind of destruction come up against Babylon and against those who are living in Chaldaea;
And I will send men to Babylon to make her clean and get her land cleared: for in the day of trouble they will put up their tents against her on every side.
Against her the bow of the archer is bent, and he puts on his coat of metal: have no mercy on her young men, give all her army up to the curse.
And the dead will be stretched out in the land of the Chaldaeans, and the wounded in her streets.
For Israel has not been given up, or Judah, by his God, by the Lord of armies; for their land is full of sin against the Holy One of Israel.
Go in flight out of Babylon, so that every man may keep his life; do not be cut off in her evil-doing: for it is the time of the Lord's punishment; he will give her her reward.
Babylon has been a gold cup in the hand of the Lord, which has made all the earth overcome with wine: the nations have taken of her wine, and for this cause the nations have gone off their heads.
Sudden is the downfall of Babylon and her destruction: make cries of grief for her; take sweet oil for her pain, if it is possible for her to be made well.
We would have made Babylon well, but she is not made well: give her up, and let us go everyone to his country: for her punishment is stretching up to heaven, and lifted up even to the skies.
The Lord has made clear our righteousness: come, and let us give an account in Zion of the work of the Lord our God.
Make bright the arrows; take up the body-covers: the Lord has been moving the spirit of the king of the Medes; because his design against Babylon is its destruction: for it is the punishment from the Lord, the payment for his Temple.
Let the flag be lifted up against the walls of Babylon , make the watch strong , put the watchmen in their places , make ready a surprise attack : for it is the Lord ' s purpose , and he has done what he said about the people of
Babylon .
O you whose living-place is by the wide waters, whose stores are great, your end is come, your evil profit is ended.
The Lord of armies has taken an oath by himself, saying, Truly, I will make you full with men as with locusts, and their voices will be loud against you.
He has made the earth by his power, he has made the world strong in its place by his wisdom, and by his wise design the heavens have been stretched out:
At the sound of his voice there is a massing of the waters in the heavens, and he makes the mists go up from the ends of the earth; he makes the thunder-flames for the rain and sends out the wind from his store-houses.
Then every man becomes like a beast without knowledge; every gold-worker is put to shame by the image he has made: for his metal image is deceit, and there is no breath in them.
They are nothing, a work of error: in the time of their punishment, destruction will overtake them.
The heritage of Jacob is not like these; for the maker of all things is his heritage: the Lord of armies is his name.
You are my fighting axe and my instrument of war: with you the nations will be broken; with you kingdoms will be broken;
With you the horse and the horseman will be broken; with you the war-carriage and he who goes in it will be broken;
With you man and woman will be broken; with you the old man and the boy will be broken; with you the young man and the virgin will be broken;
With you the keeper of sheep with his flock will be broken, and with you the farmer and his oxen will be broken, and with you captains and rulers will be broken.
And I will give to Babylon, and to all the people of Chaldaea, their reward for all the evil they have done in Zion before your eyes, says the Lord.
See, I am against you, says the Lord, O mountain of destruction, causing the destruction of all the earth: and my hand will be stretched out on you, rolling you down from the rocks, and making you a burned mountain.
And they will not take from you a stone for the angle of a wall or the base of a building; but you will be a waste place for ever, says the Lord.
Let a flag be lifted up in the land , let the horn be sounded among the nations , make the nations ready against her ; get the kingdoms of Ararat , Minni , and Ashkenaz together against her , make ready a scribe against her ; let the horses
come up against her like massed locusts .
Make the nations ready for war against her, the king of the Medes and his rulers and all his captains, and all the land under his rule.
And the land is shaking and in pain: for the purposes of the Lord are fixed, to make the land of Babylon an unpeopled waste.
Babylon's men of war have kept back from the fight, waiting in their strong places; their strength has given way, they have become like women: her houses have been put on fire, her locks are broken.
One man, running, will give word to another, and one who goes with news will be handing it on to another, to give word to the king of Babylon that his town has been taken from every quarter:
And the ways across the river have been taken, and the water-holes ... burned with fire, and the men of war are in the grip of fear.
For these are the words of the Lord of armies, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a grain-floor when it is stamped down; before long, the time of her grain-cutting will come.
Nebuchadrezzar , king of Babylon , has made a meal of me , violently crushing me , he has made me a vessel with nothing in it , he has taken me in his mouth like a dragon , he has made his stomach full with my delicate flesh ,
crushing me with his teeth .
May the violent things done to me, and my downfall, come on Babylon, the daughter of Zion will say; and, May my blood be on the people of Chaldaea, Jerusalem will say.
For this reason the Lord has said: See, I will give support to your cause, and take payment for what you have undergone; I will make her sea dry, and her fountain without water.
And Babylon will become a mass of broken walls, a hole for jackals, a cause of wonder and surprise, without a living man in it.
They will be crying out together like lions, their voices will be like the voices of young lions.
When they are heated, I will make a feast for them, and overcome them with wine, so that they may become unconscious, sleeping an eternal sleep without awaking, says the Lord.
I will make them go down to death like lambs, like he-goats together.
How is Babylon taken! and the praise of all the earth surprised! how has Babylon become a cause of wonder among the nations!
The sea has come up over Babylon; she is covered with the mass of its waves.
Her towns have become a waste, a dry and unwatered land, where no man has his living-place and no son of man goes by.
And I will send punishment on Bel in Babylon, and take out of his mouth what went into it; no longer will the nations be flowing together to him: truly, the wall of Babylon will come down.
My people, go out from her, and let every man get away safe from the burning wrath of the Lord.
So that your hearts may not become feeble and full of fear because of the news which will go about in the land ; for a story will go about one year , and after that in another year another story , and violent acts in the land , ruler
against ruler .
For this cause, truly, the days are coming when I will send punishment on the images of Babylon, and all her land will be shamed, and her dead will be falling down in her.
And the heaven and the earth and everything in them, will make a song of joy over Babylon: for those who make her waste will come from the north, says the Lord.
As Babylon had the dead of Israel put to the sword, so in Babylon the dead of all the land will be stretched out.
You who have got away safe from the sword, go, waiting for nothing; have the Lord in memory when you are far away, and keep Jerusalem in mind.
We are shamed because bitter words have come to our ears; our faces are covered with shame: for men from strange lands have come into the holy places of the Lord's house.
For this reason, see, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will send punishment on her images; and through all her land the wounded will be crying out in pain.
Even if Babylon was lifted up to heaven, even if she had the high places of her strength shut in with walls, still I would send against her those who will make her waste, says the Lord.
There is the sound of a cry from Babylon, and of a great destruction from the land of the Chaldaeans:
For the Lord is making Babylon waste, and putting an end to the great voice coming out of her; and her waves are thundering like great waters, their voice is sounding loud:
For the waster has come on her, even on Babylon, and her men of war are taken, their bows are broken: for the Lord is a rewarding God, and he will certainly give payment.
And I will make her chiefs and her wise men, her rulers and her captains and her men of war, overcome with wine; their sleep will be an eternal sleep without awaking, says the King; the Lord of armies is his name.
The Lord of armies has said: The wide walls of Babylon will be completely uncovered and her high doorways will be burned with fire; so peoples keep on working for nothing, and the weariness of nations comes to an end in the smoke.
The order which Jeremiah the prophet gave to Seraiah , the son of Neriah , the son of Mahseiah , when he went with Zedekiah , the king of Judah , to Babylon in the fourth year of his rule . Now Seraiah was the chief controller of the house
And Jeremiah put in a book all the evil which was to come on Babylon.
And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When you come to Babylon, see that you give them all these words;
And after reading them, say, O Lord, you have said about this place that it is to be cut off, so that no one will be living in it, not a man or a beast, but it will be unpeopled for ever.
And it will be that, when you have come to an end of reading this book, you are to have a stone fixed to it, and have it dropped into the Euphrates:
And you are to say, So Babylon will go down, never to be lifted up again, because of the evil which I will send on her: and weariness will overcome them. So far, these are the words of Jeremiah.
Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king; he was king for eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
And he did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as Jehoiakim had done.
And because of the wrath of the Lord this came about in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had sent them away from before him: and Zedekiah took up arms against the king of Babylon.
And in the ninth year of his rule, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, came against Jerusalem with all his army and took up his position before it, building earthworks all round it.
So the town was shut in by their forces till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
In the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the store of food in the town was almost gone, so that there was no food for the people of the land.
Then an opening was made in the wall of the town , and all the men of war went in flight out of the town by night through the doorway between the two walls which was by the king ' s garden ; ( now the Chaldaeans were stationed round
the town : ) and they went by the way of the Arabah .
And the Chaldaean army went after King Zedekiah and overtook him on the other side of Jericho, and all his army went in flight from him in every direction.
Then they made the king a prisoner and took him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath to be judged.
And the king of Babylon put the sons of Zedekiah to death before his eyes: and he put to death all the rulers of Judah in Riblah.
And he put out Zedekiah's eyes; and the king of Babylon, chaining him in iron bands, took him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
Now in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, in the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, a servant of the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem.
And he had the house of the Lord and the king's house and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burned with fire:
And the walls round Jerusalem were broken down by the Chaldaean army which was with the captain.
Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, took away as prisoners the rest of the people who were still in the town, and those who had given themselves up to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the workmen.
But Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, let the poorest of the land go on living there, to take care of the vines and the fields.
And the brass pillars which were in the house of the Lord, and the wheeled bases and the great brass water-vessel in the house of the Lord, were broken up by the Chaldaeans, who took all the brass away to Babylon.
And the pots and the spades and the scissors for the lights and the spoons, and all the brass vessels used in the Lord's house, they took away.
And the cups and the fire-trays and the basins and the pots and the supports for the lights and the spoons and the wide basins; the gold of the gold vessels, and the silver of the silver vessels, the captain of the armed men took away.
The two pillars, the great water-vessel, and the twelve brass oxen which were under it, and the ten wheeled bases, which King Solomon had made for the house of the Lord: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
And as for the pillars, one pillar was eighteen cubits high, and twelve cubits measured all round, and it was as thick as a man's hand: it was hollow.
And there was a crown of brass on it: the crown was five cubits high, circled with a network and apples all of brass; and the second pillar had the same.
There were ninety-six apples on the outside; the number of apples all round the network was a hundred.
And the captain of the armed men took Seraiah, the chief priest, and Zephaniah, the second priest, and the three door-keepers;
And from the town he took the unsexed servant who was over the men of war , and seven of the king ' s near friends who were in the town , and the scribe of the captain of the army , who was responsible for getting the people of
the land together in military order , and sixty men of the people of the land who were in the town .
These Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, took with him to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
And the king of Babylon put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was taken prisoner away from his land.
These are the people whom Nebuchadrezzar took away prisoner: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews:
And in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he took away as prisoners from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons:
In the twenty-third year of Nebuchadrezzar, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, took away as prisoners seven hundred and forty-five of the Jews: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.
And in the thirty-seventh year after Jehoiachin , king of Judah , had been taken prisoner , in the twelfth month , on the twenty-fifth day of the month , Evil-merodach , king of Babylon , in the first year after he became king , took Jehoiachin , king of
Judah , out of prison .
And he said kind words to him and put his seat higher than the seats of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.
And his prison clothing was changed, and he was a guest at the king's table every day for the rest of his life.
And for his food, the king gave him a regular amount every day till the day of his death, for the rest of his life.
Go in flight out of Jerusalem , so that you may be safe , you children of Benjamin , and let the horn be sounded in Tekoa , and the flag be lifted up on Beth-haccherem : for evil is looking out from the north , and a great destruction
The fair and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will be cut off by my hand.
Keepers of sheep with their flocks will come to her; they will put up their tents round her; everyone will get food in his place.
Make war ready against her; up! let us go up when the sun is high. Sorrow is ours! for the day is turned and the shades of evening are stretched out.
Up! let us go up by night, and send destruction on her great houses.
For this is what the Lord of armies has said: Let trees be cut down and an earthwork be placed against Jerusalem: sorrow on the false town! inside her there is nothing but cruel ways.
As the spring keeps its waters cold, so she keeps her evil in her: the sound of cruel and violent behaviour is in her; before me at all times are disease and wounds.
Undergo teaching, O Jerusalem, or my soul will be turned away from you, and I will make you a waste, an unpeopled land.
This is what the Lord of armies has said: Everything will be taken from the rest of Israel as the last grapes are taken from the vine; let your hand be turned to the small branches, like one pulling off grapes.
To whom am I to give word , witnessing so that they may take note ? see , their ears are stopped , and they are not able to give attention : see , the word of the Lord has been a cause of shame to them , they have
no delight in it .
For this reason I am full of the wrath of the Lord , I am tired of keeping it in : may it be let loose on the children in the street , and on the band of the young men together : for even the husband with his wife
will be taken , the old man with him who is full of days .
And their houses will be handed over to others, their fields and their wives together: for my hand will be stretched out against the people of the land, says the Lord.
For from the least of them even to the greatest, everyone is given up to getting money; from the prophet even to the priest, everyone is working deceit.
And they have made little of the wounds of my people, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
Let them be put to shame because they have done disgusting things . They had no shame , they were not able to become red with shame : so they will come down with those who are falling : when my punishment comes on them , they will be made
low , says the Lord .
This is what the Lord has said : Take your place looking out on the ways ; make search for the old roads , saying , Where is the good way ? and go in it that you may have rest for your souls . But they said , We
will not go in it .
And I put watchmen over you, saying, Give attention to the sound of the horn; but they said, We will not give attention.
So then, give ear, you nations, and ...
Give ear, O earth: see, I will make evil come on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not given attention to my words, and they would have nothing to do with my law.
To what purpose does sweet perfume come to me from Sheba, and spices from a far country? your burned offerings give me no pleasure, your offerings of beasts are not pleasing to me.
For this reason the Lord has said, See, I will put stones in the way of this people: and the fathers and the sons together will go falling over them; the neighbour and his friend will come to destruction.
The Lord has said, See, a people is coming from the north country, a great nation will be put in motion from the inmost parts of the earth.
Bows and spears are in their hands ; they are cruel and have no mercy ; their voice is like the thunder of the sea , and they go on horses ; everyone in his place like men going to the fight , against you , O daughter of Zion
The news of it has come to our ears; our hands have become feeble: trouble has come on us and pain, like the pain of a woman in childbirth.
Go not out into the field or by the way; for there is the sword of the attacker, and fear on every side.
O daughter of my people, put on haircloth, rolling yourself in the dust: give yourself to sorrow, as for an only son, with most bitter cries of grief; for he who makes waste will come on us suddenly.
I have made you a tester among my people, so that you may have knowledge of their way and put it to the test.
All of them are turned away, going about with false stories; they are brass and iron: they are all workers of deceit.
The blower is blowing strongly, the lead is burned away in the fire: they go on heating the metal to no purpose, for the evil-doers are not taken away.
They will be named waste silver, because the Lord has given them up.
The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,
Take your place in the doorway of the Lord's house, and give out this word there, and say, Give ear to the word of the Lord, all you of Judah who come inside these doors to give worship to the Lord.
The Lord of armies, the God of Israel, says, Let your ways and your doings be changed for the better and I will let you go on living in this place.
Put no faith in false words, saying, The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, are these.
For if your ways and your doings are truly changed for the better; if you truly give right decisions between a man and his neighbour;
If you are not cruel to the man from a strange country, and to the child without a father, and to the widow, and do not put the upright to death in this place, or go after other gods, causing damage to yourselves:
Then I will let you go on living in this place, in the land which I gave to your fathers in the past and for ever.
See, you put your faith in false words which are of no profit.
Will you take the goods of others, put men to death, and be untrue to your wives, and take false oaths, and have perfumes burned to the Baal, and go after other gods which are strange to you;
And come and take your place before me in this house, which is named by my name, and say, We have been made safe; so that you may do all these disgusting things?
Has this house, which is named by my name, become a hole of thieves to you? Truly I, even I, have seen it, says the Lord.
But go now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I put my name at first, and see what I did to it because of the evil-doing of my people Israel.
And now, because you have done all these works, says the Lord, and I sent my word to you, getting up early and sending, but you did not give ear; and my voice came to you, but you gave no answer:
For this reason I will do to the house which is named by my name, and in which you have put your faith, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.
And I will send you away from before my face, as I have sent away all your brothers, even all the seed of Ephraim.
And as for you (Jeremiah), make no prayers for this people, send up no cry or prayer for them, make no request for them to me: for I will not give ear.
Do you not see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
The children go for wood, the fathers get the fire burning, the women are working the paste to make cakes for the queen of heaven, and drink offerings are drained out to other gods, moving me to wrath.
Are they moving me to wrath? says the Lord; are they not moving themselves to their shame?
So this is what the Lord God has said : See , my wrath and my passion will be let loose on this place , on man and beast , and on the trees of the field , and on the produce of the earth ; it will be burning
and will not be put out .
These are the words of the Lord of armies, the God of Israel: Put your burned offerings with your offerings of beasts, and take flesh for your food.
For I said nothing to your fathers, and gave them no orders, on the day when I took them out of Egypt, about burned offerings or offerings of beasts:
But this was the order I gave them, saying, Give ear to my voice, and I will be your God, and you will be my people: go in all the way ordered by me, so that all may be well for you.
But they took no note and did not give ear, but were guided by the thoughts and the pride of their evil hearts, going back and not forward.
From the day when your fathers came out of Egypt till this day, I have sent my servants the prophets to you, getting up early every day and sending them:
But still they took no note and would not give ear, but they made their necks stiff, doing worse than their fathers.
And you are to say all these words to them, but they will not give ear to you: you will send out your voice to them, but they will give no answer.
And you are to say to them, This is the nation which has not given ear to the voice of their God, or taken his teaching to heart: good faith is dead and is cut off from their mouths.
Let your hair be cut off, O Jerusalem, and let it go, and let a song of grief go up on the open hilltops; for the Lord is turned away from the generation of his wrath and has given them up.
For the children of Judah have done what is evil in my eyes, says the Lord: they have put their disgusting images in the house which is named by my name, making it unclean.
And they have put up the high place of Topheth in the valley of the son of Hinnom, burning their sons and their daughters there in the fire; a thing which was not ordered by me and never came into my mind.
For this cause , the days are coming , says the Lord , when it will no longer be named Topheth , or , The valley of the son of Hinnom , but , The valley of Death : for they will put the dead into the earth in Topheth
till there is no more room .
And the bodies of this people will be food for the birds of heaven and for the beasts of the earth; and there will be no one to send them away.
And in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, I will put an end to the laughing voices, the voice of joy and the voice of the newly-married man and the voice of the bride: for the land will become a waste.
At that time , says the Lord , they will take the bones of the kings of Judah , and the bones of his rulers , and the bones of the priests , and the bones of the prophets , and the bones of the people of Jerusalem out of
their resting-places :
And they will put them out before the sun and the moon and all the stars of heaven , whose lovers and servants they have been , after whom they have gone , to whom they have made prayers , and to whom they have given worship : they will
not be put together or placed in the earth ; they will be waste on the face of the earth .
And death will be desired more than life by the rest of this evil family who are still living in all the places where I have sent them away, says the Lord of armies.
Further, you are to say to them, This is what the Lord has said: Will those who are falling not be lifted up again? will he who has gone away not come back?
Why do these people of Jerusalem go back, for ever turning away? they will not give up their deceit, they will not come back.
I took note and gave ear, but no one said what is right: no man had regret for his evil-doing, saying, What have I done? everyone goes off on his way like a horse rushing to the fight.
Truly, the stork in the heavens is conscious of her fixed times; the dove and the swallow and the crane keep to the times of their coming; but my people have no knowledge of the law of the Lord.
How is it that you say, We are wise and the law of the Lord is with us? But see, the false pen of the scribes has made it false.
The wise men are shamed, they are overcome with fear and taken: see, they have given up the word of the Lord; and what use is their wisdom to them?
So I will give their wives to others, and their fields to those who will take them for themselves: for everyone, from the least to the greatest, is given up to getting money; from the priest even to the prophet, everyone is false.
And they have made little of the wounds of the daughter of Zion, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
Let them be put to shame because they have done disgusting things . They had no shame , they were not able to become red with shame : so they will come down with those who are falling : in the time of their punishment they will be made low
, says the Lord .
I will put an end to them completely, says the Lord: there are no grapes on the vine and no figs on the fig-tree, and the leaf is dry.
Why are we seated doing nothing ? come together , and let us go to the walled towns , and let destruction overtake us there , for the Lord our God has sent destruction on us , and given us bitter water for our drink , because we have done
evil against the Lord .
We were looking for peace, but no good came; and for a time of well-being, but there is only a great fear.
The loud breathing of the horses comes to our ears from Dan : at the sound of the outcry of his war-horses , all the land is shaking with fear ; for they have come , and have made a meal of the land and everything in it ; the
town and the people living in it .
See, I will send snakes and poison-snakes among you, against which the wonder-worker has no power; and they will give you wounds which may not be made well, says the Lord.
Sorrow has come on me! my heart in me is feeble.
The voice of the cry of the daughter of my people comes from a far land: Is the Lord not in Zion? is not her King in her? Why have they made me angry with their images and their strange gods which are no gods?
The grain-cutting is past, the summer is ended, and no salvation has come to us.
For the destruction of the daughter of my people I am broken: I am dressed in the clothing of grief; fear has taken me in its grip.
Is there no life-giving oil in Gilead? is there no expert in medical arts? why then have my people not been made well?
If only my head was a stream of waters and my eyes fountains of weeping, so that I might go on weeping day and night for the dead of the daughter of my people!
If only I had in the waste land a night's resting-place for travellers, so that I might go away, far from my people! for they are all untrue, a band of false men.
Their tongues are bent like a bow to send out false words: they have become strong in the land, but not for good faith: they go on from evil to evil, and they have no knowledge of me, says the Lord.
Let everyone keep watch on his neighbour, and put no faith in any brother: for every brother will certainly be tricking his brother, and every neighbour will go about saying evil.
Everyone will make sport of his neighbour with deceit, not saying what is true: their tongues have been trained to say false words; they are twisted, hating to come back.
There is wrong on wrong, deceit on deceit; they have given up the knowledge of me, says the Lord.
So the Lord of armies has said, See, I will make them soft in the fire and put them to the test; this I will do because of their evil-doing.
His tongue is an arrow causing death; the words of his mouth are deceit: he says words of peace to his neighbour, but in his heart he is waiting secretly for him.
Am I not to send punishment for these things? says the Lord: will not my soul take payment from such a nation as this?
Give yourselves to weeping , crying out in sorrow for the mountains ; and for the fields of the waste land send up a song of grief , because they are burned up , so that no one goes through ; there is no sound of cattle ; the bird
of the heavens and the beast are in flight and are gone .
And I will make Jerusalem a mass of broken stones, the living-place of jackals; and I will make the towns of Judah a waste, with no man living there.
Who is the wise man able to see this ? who is he to whom the word of the Lord has come , so that he may make it clear ? why is the land given to destruction and burned up like a waste place , so that no one
goes through ?
And the Lord said, Because they have given up my law which I put before them, giving no attention to my voice and not being guided by it;
But they have been walking in the pride of their hearts, going after the Baals, as their fathers gave them teaching.
So the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said, I will give them, even this people, bitter plants for food and bitter water for drink.
And I will send them wandering among the nations, among people strange to them and to their fathers: and I will send the sword after them till I have put an end to them.
This is what the Lord of armies has said: Take thought and send for the weeping women, so that they may come; and send for the wise women, so that they may come:
Let them quickly make cries of sorrow for us, so that drops may be flowing from our eyes till they are streaming with water.
For a sound of weeping goes up from Zion, a cry, How has destruction come on us? we are overcome with shame because we have gone away from our land; he has sent us out from our house.
But even now, give ear to the word of the Lord, O you women; let your ears be open to the word of his mouth, training your daughters to give cries of sorrow, everyone teaching her neighbour a song of grief.
For death has come up into our windows, forcing its way into our great houses; cutting off the children in the streets and the young men in the wide places.
The bodies of men will be falling like waste on the open fields, and like grain dropped by the grain-cutter, and no one will take them up.
This is the word of the Lord: Let not the wise man take pride in his wisdom, or the strong man in his strength, or the man of wealth in his wealth:
But if any man has pride , let it be in this , that he has the wisdom to have knowledge of me , that I am the Lord , working mercy , giving true decisions , and doing righteousness in the earth : for in these things I have
delight , says the Lord .
See, the day is coming, says the Lord, when I will send punishment on all those who have circumcision in the flesh;
On Egypt and on Judah and on Edom and on the children of Ammon and on Moab and on all who have the ends of their hair cut , who are living in the waste land : for all these nations and all the people of Israel are without circumcision
in their hearts .
There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. He was without sin and upright, fearing God and keeping himself far from evil.
And he had seven sons and three daughters.
And of cattle he had seven thousand sheep and goats, and three thousand camels, and a thousand oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great number of servants. And the man was greater than any of the sons of the east.
His sons regularly went to one another's houses, and every one on his day gave a feast: and at these times they sent for their three sisters to take part in their feasts with them.
And at the end of their days of feasting , Job sent and made them clean , getting up early in the morning and offering burned offerings for them all . For , Job said , It may be that my sons have done wrong and said evil of God
in their hearts . And Job did this whenever the feasts came round .
And there was a day when the sons of the gods came together before the Lord, and the Satan came with them.
And the Lord said to the Satan, Where do you come from? And the Satan said in answer, From wandering this way and that on the earth, and walking about on it.
And the Lord said to the Satan, Have you taken note of my servant Job, for there is no one like him on the earth, a man without sin and upright, fearing God and keeping himself far from evil?
And the Satan said in answer to the Lord, Is it for nothing that Job is a god-fearing man?
Have you yourself not put a wall round him and his house and all he has on every side, blessing the work of his hands, and increasing his cattle in the land?
But now, put out your hand against all he has, and he will be cursing you to your face.
And the Lord said to the Satan, See, I give all he has into your hands, only do not put a finger on the man himself. And the Satan went out from before the Lord.
And there was a day when his sons and daughters were feasting in the house of their oldest brother,
And a man came to Job, and said, The oxen were ploughing, and the asses were taking their food by their side:
And the men of Sheba came against them and took them away, putting the young men to the sword, and I was the only one who got away safe to give you the news.
And this one was still talking when another came , and said , The fire of God came down from heaven , burning up the sheep and the goats and the young men completely , and I was the only one who got away safe to give you the news
And this one was still talking when another came , and said , The Chaldaeans made themselves into three bands , and came down on the camels and took them away , putting the young men to the sword , and I was the only one who got away safe
to give you the news .
And this one was still talking when another came, and said, Your sons and your daughters were feasting together in their oldest brother's house,
When a great wind came rushing from the waste land against the four sides of the house, and it came down on the young men, and they are dead; and I was the only one who got away safe to give you the news.
Then Job got up, and after parting his clothing and cutting off his hair, he went down on his face to the earth, and gave worship, and said,
With nothing I came out of my mother's body, and with nothing I will go back there; the Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; let the Lord's name be praised.
In all this Job did no sin, and did not say that God's acts were foolish.
My soul is tired of life; I will let my sad thoughts go free in words; my soul will make a bitter outcry.
I will say to God, Do not put me down as a sinner; make clear to me what you have against me.
What profit is it to you to be cruel, to give up the work of your hands, looking kindly on the design of evil-doers?
Have you eyes of flesh, or do you see as man sees?
Are your days as the days of man, or your years like his,
That you take note of my sin, searching after my wrongdoing,
Though you see that I am not an evil-doer; and there is no one who is able to take a man out of your hands?
Your hands made me, and I was formed by you, but then, changing your purpose, you gave me up to destruction.
O keep in mind that you made me out of earth; and will you send me back again to dust?
Was I not drained out like milk, becoming hard like cheese?
By you I was clothed with skin and flesh, and joined together with bones and muscles.
You have been kind to me, and your grace has been with me, and your care has kept my spirit safe.
But you kept these things in the secret of your heart; I am certain this was in your thoughts:
That, if I did wrong, you would take note of it, and would not make me clear from sin:
That, if I was an evil-doer, the curse would come on me; and if I was upright, my head would not be lifted up, being full of shame and overcome with trouble.
And that if there was cause for pride, you would go after me like a lion; and again put out your wonders against me:
That you would send new witnesses against me, increasing your wrath against me, and letting loose new armies on me.
Why then did you make me come out of my mother's body? It would have been better for me to have taken my last breath, and for no eye to have seen me,
And for me to have been as if I had not been; to have been taken from my mother's body straight to my last resting-place.
Are not the days of my life small in number? Let your eyes be turned away from me, so that I may have a little pleasure,
Before I go to the place from which I will not come back, to the land where all is dark and black,
A land of thick dark, without order, where the very light is dark.
Then Zophar the Naamathite made answer and said,
Are all these words to go unanswered? and is a man seen to be right because he is full of talk?
Are your words of pride to make men keep quiet? and are you to make sport, with no one to put you to shame?
You may say, My way is clean, and I am free from sin in your eyes.
But if only God would take up the word, opening his lips in argument with you;
And would make clear to you the secrets of wisdom, and the wonders of his purpose!
Are you able to take God's measure, to make discovery of the limits of the Ruler of all?
They are higher than heaven; what is there for you to do? deeper than the underworld, and outside your knowledge;
Longer in measure than the earth, and wider than the sea.
If he goes on his way, shutting a man up and putting him to death, who may make him go back from his purpose?
For in his eyes men are as nothing; he sees evil and takes note of it.
And so a hollow-minded man will get wisdom, when a young ass of the field gets teaching.
But if you put your heart right, stretching out your hands to him;
If you put far away the evil of your hands, and let no wrongdoing have a place in your tent;
Then truly your face will be lifted up, with no mark of sin, and you will be fixed in your place without fear:
For your sorrow will go from your memory, like waters flowing away:
And your life will be brighter than day; though it is dark, it will become like the morning.
And you will be safe because there is hope; after looking round, you will take your rest in quiet;
Sleeping with no fear of danger; and men will be desiring to have grace in your eyes;
But the eyes of the evil-doers will be wasting away; their way of flight is gone, and their only hope is the taking of their last breath.
And Job made answer and said,
No doubt you have knowledge, and wisdom will come to an end with you.
But I have a mind as well as you; I am equal to you: yes, who has not knowledge of such things as these?
It seems that I am to be as one who is a cause of laughing to his neighbour, one who makes his prayer to God and is answered! the upright man who has done no wrong is to be made sport of!
In the thought of him who is in comfort there is no respect for one who is in trouble; such is the fate of those whose feet are slipping.
There is wealth in the tents of those who make destruction, and those by whom God is moved to wrath are safe; even those whose god is their strength.
But put now a question to the beasts, and get teaching from them; or to the birds of the heaven, and they will make it clear to you;
Or to the things which go flat on the earth, and they will give you wisdom; and the fishes of the sea will give you news of it.
Who does not see by all these that the hand of the Lord has done this?
In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all flesh of man.
Are not words tested by the ear, even as food is tasted by the mouth?
Old men have wisdom, and a long life gives knowledge.
With him there is wisdom and strength; power and knowledge are his.
Truly, there is no building up of what is pulled down by him; when a man is shut up by him, no one may let him loose.
Truly, he keeps back the waters and they are dry; he sends them out and the earth is overturned.
With him are strength and wise designs; he who is guided into error, together with his guide, are in his hands;
He takes away the wisdom of the wise guides, and makes judges foolish;
He undoes the chains of kings, and puts his band on them;
He makes priests prisoners, overturning those in safe positions;
He makes the words of responsible persons without effect, and takes away the good sense of the old;
He puts shame on chiefs, and takes away the power of the strong;
Uncovering deep things out of the dark, and making the deep shade bright;
Increasing nations, and sending destruction on them; making wide the lands of peoples, and then giving them up.
He takes away the wisdom of the rulers of the earth, and sends them wandering in a waste where there is no way.
They go feeling about in the dark without light, wandering without help like those overcome with wine.
Truly, my eye has seen all this, word of it has come to my ear, and I have knowledge of it.
The same things are in my mind as in yours; I am equal to you.
But I would have talk with the Ruler of all, and my desire is to have an argument with God.
But you put a false face on things; all your attempts to put things right are of no value.
If only you would keep quiet, it would be a sign of wisdom!
Give ear to the argument of my mouth, and take note of the words of my lips.
Will you say in God's name what is not right, and put false words into his mouth?
Will you have respect for God's person in this cause, and put yourselves forward as his supporters?
Will it be good for you to be searched out by him, or have you the thought that he may be guided into error like a man?
He will certainly put you right, if you have respect for persons in secret.
Will not his glory put you in fear, so that your hearts will be overcome before him?
Your wise sayings are only dust, and your strong places are only earth.
Keep quiet, and let me say what is in my mind, whatever may come to me.
I will take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand.
Truly, he will put an end to me; I have no hope; but I will not give way in argument before him;
And that will be my salvation, for an evil-doer would not come before him,
Give ear with care to my words, and keep what I say in your minds.
See now, I have put my cause in order, and I am certain that I will be seen to be right.
Is any one able to take up the argument against me? If so, I would keep quiet and give up my breath.
Only two things do not do to me, then I will come before your face:
Take your hand far away from me; and let me not be overcome by fear of you.
Then at the sound of your voice I will give answer; or let me put forward my cause for you to give me an answer.
What is the number of my evil-doings and my sins? give me knowledge of them.
Why is your face veiled from me, as if I was numbered among your haters?
Will you be hard on a leaf in flight before the wind? will you make a dry stem go more quickly on its way?
For you put bitter things on record against me, and send punishment on me for the sins of my early years;
And you put chains on my feet, watching all my ways, and making a limit for my steps;
Though a man comes to nothing like a bit of dead wood, or like a robe which has become food for the worm.
As for man, the son of woman, his days are short and full of trouble.
He comes out like a flower, and is cut down: he goes in flight like a shade, and is never seen again.
Is it on such a one as this that your eyes are fixed, with the purpose of judging him?
If only a clean thing might come out of an unclean! But it is not possible.
If his days are ordered, and you have knowledge of the number of his months, having given him a fixed limit past which he may not go;
Let your eyes be turned away from him, and take your hand from him, so that he may have pleasure at the end of his day, like a servant working for payment.
For there is hope of a tree; if it is cut down, it will come to life again, and its branches will not come to an end.
Though its root may be old in the earth, and its cut-off end may be dead in the dust;
Still, at the smell of water, it will make buds, and put out branches like a young plant.
But man comes to his death and is gone: he gives up his spirit, and where is he?
The waters go from a pool, and a river becomes waste and dry;
So man goes down to his last resting-place and comes not again: till the heavens come to an end, they will not be awake or come out of their sleep.
If only you would keep me safe in the underworld, putting me in a secret place till your wrath is past, giving me a fixed time when I might come to your memory again!
If death takes a man, will he come to life again? All the days of my trouble I would be waiting, till the time came for me to be free.
At the sound of your voice I would give an answer, and you would have a desire for the work of your hands.
For now my steps are numbered by you, and my sin is not overlooked.
My wrongdoing is corded up in a bag, and my sin is shut up safe.
But truly a mountain falling comes to dust, and a rock is moved from its place;
The stones are crushed small by the force of the waters; the dust of the earth is washed away by their overflowing: and so you put an end to the hope of man.
You overcome him for ever, and he is gone; his face is changed in death, and you send him away.
His sons come to honour, and he has no knowledge of it; they are made low, but he is not conscious of it.
Only his flesh still has pain, and his soul is sad.
And Eliphaz the Temanite made answer and said,
Will a wise man make answer with knowledge of no value, or will he give birth to the east wind?
Will he make arguments with words in which is no profit, and with sayings which have no value?
Truly, you make the fear of God without effect, so that the time of quiet worship before God is made less by your outcry.
For your mouth is guided by your sin, and you have taken the tongue of the false for yourself.
It is by your mouth, even yours, that you are judged to be in the wrong, and not by me; and your lips give witness against you.
Were you the first man to come into the world? or did you come into being before the hills?
Were you present at the secret meeting of God? and have you taken all wisdom for yourself?
What knowledge have you which we have not? is there anything in your mind which is not in ours?
With us are men who are grey-haired and full of years, much older than your father.
Are the comforts of God not enough for you, and the gentle word which was said to you?
Why is your heart uncontrolled, and why are your eyes lifted up;
So that you are turning your spirit against God, and letting such words go out of your mouth?
What is man, that he may be clean? and how may the son of woman be upright?
Truly, he puts no faith in his holy ones, and the heavens are not clean in his eyes;
How much less one who is disgusting and unclean, a man who takes in evil like water!
Take note and give ear to my words; and I will say what I have seen:
(The things which wise men have got from their fathers, and have not kept secret from us;
For only to them was the land given, and no strange people were among them:)
The evil man is in pain all his days, and the number of the years stored up for the cruel is small.
A sound of fear is in his ears; in time of peace destruction will come on him:
He has no hope of coming safe out of the dark, and his fate will be the sword;
He is wandering about in search of bread, saying, Where is it? and he is certain that the day of trouble is ready for him:
He is greatly in fear of the dark day, trouble and pain overcome him:
Because his hand is stretched out against God, and his heart is lifted up against the Ruler of all,
Running against him like a man of war, covered by his thick breastplate; even like a king ready for the fight,
Because his face is covered with fat, and his body has become thick;
And he has made his resting-place in the towns which have been pulled down, in houses where no man had a right to be, whose fate was to become masses of broken walls.
He does not get wealth for himself, and is unable to keep what he has got; the heads of his grain are not bent down to the earth.
He does not come out of the dark; his branches are burned by the flame, and the wind takes away his bud.
Let him not put his hope in what is false, falling into error: for he will get deceit as his reward.
His branch is cut off before its time, and his leaf is no longer green.
He is like a vine whose grapes do not come to full growth, or an olive-tree dropping its flowers.
For the band of the evil-doers gives no fruit, and the tents of those who give wrong decisions for reward are burned with fire.
Evil has made them with child, and they give birth to trouble; and the fruit of their body is shame for themselves.
And Job made answer and said,
Such things have frequently come to my ears: you are comforters who only give trouble.
May words which are like the wind be stopped? or what is troubling you to make answer to them?
It would not be hard for me to say such things if your souls were in my soul's place; joining words together against you, and shaking my head at you:
I might give you strength with my mouth, and not keep back the comfort of my lips.
If I say what is in my mind, my pain becomes no less: and if I keep quiet, how much of it goes from me?
But now he has overcome me with weariness and fear, and I am in the grip of all my trouble.
It has come up as a witness against me, and the wasting of my flesh makes answer to my face.
I am broken by his wrath, and his hate has gone after me; he has made his teeth sharp against me: my haters are looking on me with cruel eyes;
Their mouths are open wide against me; the blows of his bitter words are falling on my face; all of them come together in a mass against me.
God gives me over to the power of sinners, sending me violently into the hands of evil-doers.
I was in comfort, but I have been broken up by his hands; he has taken me by the neck, shaking me to bits; he has put me up as a mark for his arrows.
His bowmen come round about me; their arrows go through my body without mercy; my life is drained out on the earth.
I am broken with wound after wound; he comes rushing on me like a man of war.
I have made haircloth the clothing of my skin, and my horn is rolled in the dust.
My face is red with weeping, and my eyes are becoming dark;
Though my hands have done no violent acts, and my prayer is clean.
O earth, let not my blood be covered, and let my cry have no resting-place!
Even now my witness is in heaven, and the supporter of my cause is on high.
My friends make sport of me; to God my eyes are weeping,
So that he may give decision for a man in his cause with God, and between a son of man and his neighbour.
For in a short time I will take the journey from which I will not come back.
My spirit is broken, my days are ended, the last resting-place is ready for me.
Truly, those who make sport of me are round about me, and my eyes become dark because of their bitter laughing.
Be pleased, now, to be responsible for me to yourself; for there is no other who will put his hand in mine.
You have kept their hearts from wisdom: for this cause you will not give them honour.
As for him who is false to his friend for a reward, light will be cut off from the eyes of his children.
He has made me a word of shame to the peoples; I have become a mark for their sport.
My eyes have become dark because of my pain, and all my body is wasted to a shade.
The upright are surprised at this, and he who has done no wrong is troubled because of the evil-doers.
Still the upright keeps on his way, and he who has clean hands gets new strength.
But come back, now, all of you, come; and I will not see a wise man among you.
My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the desires of my heart.
They are changing night into day; they say, The light is near the dark.
If I am waiting for the underworld as my house, if I have made my bed in the dark;
If I say to the earth, You are my father; and to the worm, My mother and my sister;
Where then is my hope? and who will see my desire?
Will they go down with me into the underworld? Will we go down together into the dust?
Then Bildad the Shuhite made answer and said,
How long will it be before you have done talking? Get wisdom, and then we will say what is in our minds.
Why do we seem as beasts in your eyes, and as completely without knowledge?
But come back, now, come: you who are wounding yourself in your passion, will the earth be given up because of you, or a rock be moved out of its place?
For the light of the sinner is put out, and the flame of his fire is not shining.
The light is dark in his tent, and the light shining over him is put out.
The steps of his strength become short, and by his design destruction overtakes him.
His feet take him into the net, and he goes walking into the cords.
His foot is taken in the net; he comes into its grip.
The twisted cord is put secretly in the earth to take him, and the cord is placed in his way.
He is overcome by fears on every side, they go after him at every step.
His strength is made feeble for need of food, and destruction is waiting for his falling footstep.
His skin is wasted by disease, and his body is food for the worst of diseases.
He is pulled out of his tent where he was safe, and he is taken away to the king of fears.
In his tent will be seen that which is not his, burning stone is dropped on his house.
Under the earth his roots are dry, and over it his branch is cut off.
His memory is gone from the earth, and in the open country there is no knowledge of his name.
He is sent away from the light into the dark; he is forced out of the world.
He has no offspring or family among his people, and in his living-place there is no one of his name.
At his fate those of the west are shocked, and those of the east are overcome with fear.
Truly, these are the houses of the sinner, and this is the place of him who has no knowledge of God.
And Job made answer and said,
How long will you make my life bitter, crushing me with words?
Ten times now you have made sport of me; it gives you no sense of shame to do me wrong.
And, truly, if I have been in error, the effect of my error is only on myself.
If you make yourselves great against me, using my punishment as an argument against me,
Be certain that it is God who has done me wrong, and has taken me in his net.
Truly, I make an outcry against the violent man, but there is no answer: I give a cry for help, but no one takes up my cause.
My way is walled up by him so that I may not go by: he has made my roads dark.
He has put off my glory from me, and taken the crown from my head.
I am broken down by him on every side, and I am gone; my hope is uprooted like a tree.
His wrath is burning against me, and I am to him as one of his haters.
His armies come on together, they make their road high against me, and put up their tents round mine.
He has taken my brothers far away from me; they have seen my fate and have become strange to me.
My relations and my near friends have given me up, and those living in my house have put me out of their minds.
I am strange to my women-servants, and seem to them as one from another country.
At my cry my servant gives me no answer, and I have to make a prayer to him.
My breath is strange to my wife, and I am disgusting to the offspring of my mother's body.
Even young children have no respect for me; when I get up their backs are turned on me.
All the men of my circle keep away from me; and those dear to me are turned against me.
My bones are joined to my skin, and I have got away with my flesh in my teeth.
Have pity on me, have pity on me, O my friends! for the hand of God is on me.
Why are you cruel to me, like God, for ever saying evil against me?
If only my words might be recorded! if they might be put in writing in a book!
And with an iron pen and lead be cut into the rock for ever!
But I am certain that he who will take up my cause is living, and that in time to come he will take his place on the dust;
And ... without my flesh I will see God;
Whom I will see on my side, and not as one strange to me. My heart is broken with desire.
If you say, How cruel we will be to him! because the root of sin is clearly in him:
Be in fear of the sword, for the sword is the punishment for such things, so that you may be certain that there is a judge.
And there was a day when the sons of the gods came together before the Lord, and the Satan came with them.
And the Lord said to the Satan, Where do you come from? And the Satan said in answer, From wandering this way and that on the earth, and walking about on it.
And the Lord said to the Satan , Have you taken note of my servant Job , for there is no one like him on the earth , a man without sin and upright , fearing God and keeping himself far from evil ? and he still keeps his righteousness
, though you have been moving me to send destruction on him without cause .
And the Satan said in answer to the Lord, Skin for skin, all a man has he will give for his life.
But now, if you only put your hand on his bone and his flesh, he will certainly be cursing you to your face.
And the Lord said to the Satan, See, he is in your hands, only do not take his life.
And the Satan went out from before the Lord, and sent on Job an evil disease covering his skin from his feet to the top of his head.
And he took a broken bit of a pot, and, seated in the dust, was rubbing himself with the sharp edge of it.
And his wife said to him, Are you still keeping your righteousness? Say a curse against God, and put an end to yourself.
And he said to her, You are talking like one of the foolish women. If we take the good God sends us, are we not to take the evil when it comes? In all this Job kept his lips from sin.
And Job ' s three friends had word of all this evil which had come on him . And they came every one from his place , Eliphaz the Temanite , and Bildad the Shuhite , and Zophar the Naamathite . So they came together to a meeting-place , in
order that they might go and make clear to Job their grief for him , and give him comfort .
And lifting up their eyes when they were still far off, it did not seem that the man they saw was Job because of the change in him. And they gave way to bitter weeping, with signs of grief, and put dust on their heads.
And they took their seats on the earth by his side for seven days and seven nights: but no one said a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.
Then Zophar the Naamathite made answer and said,
For this cause my thoughts are troubling me and driving me on.
I have to give ear to arguments which put me to shame, and your answers to me are wind without wisdom.
Have you knowledge of this from early times, when man was placed on the earth,
That the pride of the sinner is short, and the joy of the evil-doer but for a minute?
Though he is lifted up to the heavens, and his head goes up to the clouds;
Like the waste from his body he comes to an end for ever: those who have seen him say, Where is he?
He is gone like a dream, and is not seen again; he goes in flight like a vision of the night.
The eye which saw him sees him no longer; and his place has no more knowledge of him.
His children are hoping that the poor will be kind to them, and his hands give back his wealth.
His bones are full of young strength, but it will go down with him into the dust.
Though evil-doing is sweet in his mouth, and he keeps it secretly under his tongue;
Though he takes care of it, and does not let it go, but keeps it still in his mouth;
His food becomes bitter in his stomach; the poison of snakes is inside him.
He takes down wealth as food, and sends it up again; it is forced out of his stomach by God.
He takes the poison of snakes into his mouth, the tongue of the snake is the cause of his death.
Let him not see the rivers of oil, the streams of honey and milk.
He is forced to give back the fruit of his work, and may not take it for food; he has no joy in the profit of his trading.
Because he has been cruel to the poor, turning away from them in their trouble; because he has taken a house by force which he did not put up;
There is no peace for him in his wealth, and no salvation for him in those things in which he took delight.
He had never enough for his desire; for this cause his well-being will quickly come to an end.
Even when his wealth is great, he is full of care, for the hand of everyone who is in trouble is turned against him.
God gives him his desire, and sends the heat of his wrath on him, making it come down on him like rain.
He may go in flight from the iron spear, but the arrow from the bow of brass will go through him;
He is pulling it out, and it comes out of his back; and its shining point comes out of his side; he is overcome by fears.
All his wealth is stored up for the dark: a fire not made by man sends destruction on him, and on everything in his tent.
The heavens make clear his sin, and the earth gives witness against him.
The produce of his house is taken away into another country, like things given into the hands of others in the day of wrath.
This is the reward of the evil man, and the heritage given to him by God.
Then Job made answer and said,
Give attention with care to my words; and let this be your comfort.
Let me say what is in my mind, and after that, go on making sport of me.
As for me, is my outcry against man? is it then to be wondered at if my spirit is troubled?
Take note of me and be full of wonder, put your hand on your mouth.
At the very thought of it my flesh is shaking with fear.
Why is life given to the evil-doers? why do they become old and strong in power?
Their children are ever with them, and their offspring before their eyes.
Their houses are free from fear, and the rod of God does not come on them.
Their ox is ready at all times to give seed; their cow gives birth, without dropping her young.
They send out their young ones like a flock, and their children have pleasure in the dance,
They make songs to the instruments of music, and are glad at the sound of the pipe.
Their days come to an end without trouble, and suddenly they go down to the underworld.
Though they said to God, Go away from us, for we have no desire for the knowledge of your ways.
What is the Ruler of all, that we may give him worship? and what profit is it to us to make prayer to him?
Truly, is not their well-being in their power? (The purpose of the evil-doers is far from me.)
How frequently is the light of the evil-doers put out, or does trouble come on them? how frequently does his wrath take them with cords?
How frequently are they as dry stems before the wind, or as grass taken away by the storm-wind?
You say, God keeps punishment stored up for his children. Let him send it on the man himself, so that he may have the punishment of it!
Let his eyes see his trouble, and let him be full of the wrath of the Ruler of all!
For what interest has he in his house after him, when the number of his months is ended?
Is anyone able to give teaching to God? for he is the judge of those who are on high.
One comes to his end in complete well-being, full of peace and quiet:
His buckets are full of milk, and there is no loss of strength in his bones.
And another comes to his end with a bitter soul, without ever tasting good.
Together they go down to the dust, and are covered by the worm.
See, I am conscious of your thoughts, and of your violent purposes against me;
For you say, Where is the house of the ruler, and where is the tent of the evil-doer?
Have you not put the question to the travellers, and do you not take note of their experience?
How the evil man goes free in the day of trouble, and has salvation in the day of wrath?
Who will make his way clear to his face? and if he has done a thing, who gives him punishment for it?
He is taken to his last resting-place, and keeps watch over it.
The earth of the valley covering his bones is sweet to him, and all men come after him, as there were unnumbered before him.
Why then do you give me comfort with words in which there is no profit, when you see that there is nothing in your answers but deceit?
Then Eliphaz the Temanite made answer and said,
Is it possible for a man to be of profit to God? No, for a man's wisdom is only of profit to himself.
Is it of any interest to the Ruler of all that you are upright? or is it of use to him that your ways are without sin?
Is it because you give him honour that he is sending punishment on you and is judging you?
Is not your evil-doing great? and there is no end to your sins.
For you have taken your brother's goods when he was not in your debt, and have taken away the clothing of those who have need of it.
You do not give water to the tired traveller, and from him who has no food you keep back bread.
For it was the man with power who had the land, and the man with an honoured name who was living in it.
You have sent widows away without hearing their cause, and you have taken away the support of the child who has no father.
For this cause nets are round your feet, and you are overcome with sudden fear.
Your light is made dark so that you are unable to see, and you are covered by a mass of waters.
Is not God as high as heaven? and see the stars, how high they are!
And you say, What knowledge has God? is he able to give decisions through the deep dark?
Thick clouds are covering him, so that he is unable to see; and he is walking on the arch of heaven.
Will you keep the old way by which evil men went?
Who were violently taken away before their time, who were overcome by the rush of waters:
Who said to God, Go away from us; and, What is the Ruler of all able to do to us?
Though he made their houses full of good things: but the purpose of the evil-doers is far from me!
The upright saw it and were glad: and those who had done no wrong made sport of them,
Saying, Truly, their substance is cut off, and their wealth is food for the fire.
Put yourself now in a right relation with him and be at peace: so will you do well in your undertakings.
Be pleased to take teaching from his mouth, and let his words be stored up in your heart.
If you come back to the Ruler of all, making yourself low before him; if you put evil far away from your tents;
And put your gold in the dust, even your gold of Ophir among the rocks of the valleys;
Then the Ruler of all will be your gold, and his teaching will be your silver;
For then you will have delight in the Ruler of all, and your face will be lifted up to God.
You will make your prayer to him, and be answered; and you will give effect to your oaths.
Your purposes will come about, and light will be shining on your ways.
For God makes low those whose hearts are lifted up, but he is a saviour to the poor in spirit.
He makes safe the man who is free from sin, and if your hands are clean, salvation will be yours.
And Job made answer and said,
Even today my outcry is bitter; his hand is hard on my sorrow.
If only I had knowledge of where he might be seen, so that I might come even to his seat!
I would put my cause in order before him, and my mouth would be full of arguments.
I would see what his answers would be, and have knowledge of what he would say to me.
Would he make use of his great power to overcome me? No, but he would give attention to me.
There an upright man might put his cause before him; and I would be free for ever from my judge.
See, I go forward, but he is not there; and back, but I do not see him;
I am looking for him on the left hand, but there is no sign of him; and turning to the right, I am not able to see him.
For he has knowledge of the way I take; after I have been tested I will come out like gold.
My feet have gone in his steps; I have kept in his way, without turning to one side or to the other.
I have never gone against the orders of his lips; the words of his mouth have been stored up in my heart.
But his purpose is fixed and there is no changing it; and he gives effect to the desire of his soul.
For what has been ordered for me by him will be gone through to the end: and his mind is full of such designs.
For this cause I am in fear before him, my thoughts of him overcome me.
For God has made my heart feeble, and my mind is troubled before the Ruler of all.
For I am overcome by the dark, and by the black night which is covering my face.
Why are times not stored up by the Ruler of all, and why do those who have knowledge of him not see his days?
The landmarks are changed by evil men, they violently take away flocks, together with their keepers.
They send away the ass of him who has no father, they take the widow's ox for debt.
The crushed are turned out of the way; all the poor of the earth go into a secret place together.
Like asses in the waste land they go out to their work, looking for food with care; from the waste land they get bread for their children.
They get mixed grain from the field, and they take away the late fruit from the vines of those who have wealth.
They take their rest at night without clothing, and have no cover in the cold.
They are wet with the rain of the mountains, and get into the cracks of the rock for cover.
The child without a father is forced from its mother's breast, and they take the young children of the poor for debt.
Others go about without clothing, and though they have no food, they get in the grain from the fields.
Between the lines of olive-trees they make oil; though they have no drink, they are crushing out the grapes.
From the town come sounds of pain from those who are near death, and the soul of the wounded is crying out for help; but God does not take note of their prayer.
Then there are those who are haters of the light, who have no knowledge of its ways, and do not go in them.
He who is purposing death gets up before day, so that he may put to death the poor and those in need.
And the man whose desire is for the wife of another is waiting for the evening, saying, No eye will see me; and he puts a cover on his face. And in the night the thief goes about;
In the dark he makes holes in the walls of houses: in the daytime they are shutting themselves up, they have no knowledge of the light.
For the middle of the night is as morning to them, they are not troubled by the fear of the dark.
They go quickly on the face of the waters; their heritage is cursed in the earth; the steps of the crusher of grapes are not turned to their vine-garden.
Snow waters become dry with the heat: so do sinners go down into the underworld.
The public place of his town has no more knowledge of him, and his name has gone from the memory of men: he is rooted up like a dead tree.
He is not kind to the widow, and he has no pity for her child.
But God by his power gives long life to the strong; he gets up again, though he has no hope of life.
He takes away his fear of danger and gives him support; and his eyes are on his ways.
For a short time they are lifted up; then they are gone; they are made low, they are pulled off like fruit, and like the heads of grain they are cut off.
And if it is not so, now, who will make it clear that my words are false, and that what I say is of no value?
Then Bildad the Shuhite made answer and said,
Rule and power are his; he makes peace in his high places.
Is it possible for his armies to be numbered? and on whom is not his light shining?
How then is it possible for man to be upright before God? or how may he be clean who is a son of woman?
See, even the moon is not bright, and the stars are not clean in his eyes:
How much less man who is an insect, and the son of man who is a worm!
Then Job made answer and said,
How have you given help to him who has no power! how have you been the salvation of the arm which has no strength!
How have you given teaching to him who has no wisdom, and fully made clear true knowledge!
To whom have your words been said? and whose spirit came out from you?
The shades in the underworld are shaking; the waters and those living in them.
The underworld is uncovered before him, and Destruction has no veil.
By his hand the north is stretched out in space, and the earth is hanging on nothing.
By him the waters are shut up in his thick clouds, and the cloud does not give way under them.
By him the face of his high seat is veiled, and his cloud stretched out over it.
By him a circle is marked out on the face of the waters, to the limits of the light and the dark.
The pillars of heaven are shaking, and are overcome by his sharp words.
By his power the sea was made quiet; and by his wisdom Rahab was wounded.
By his wind the heavens become bright: by his hand the quickly moving snake was cut through.
See, these are only the outskirts of his ways; and how small is that which comes to our ears about him! But the thunder of his acts of power is outside all knowledge.
And Job again took up the word and said,
By the life of God, who has taken away my right; and of the Ruler of all, who has made my soul bitter;
(For all my breath is still in me, and the spirit of God is my life;)
Truly, there is no deceit in my lips, and my tongue does not say what is false.
Let it be far from me! I will certainly not say that you are right! I will come to death before I give up my righteousness.
I will keep it safe, and will not let it go: my heart has nothing to say against any part of my life.
Let my hater be like the evil man, and let him who comes against me be as the sinner.
For what is the hope of the sinner when he is cut off, when God takes back his soul?
Will his cry come to the ears of God when he is in trouble?
Will he take delight in the Ruler of all, and make his prayer to God at all times?
I will give you teaching about the hand of God; I will not keep secret from you what is in the mind of the Ruler of all.
Truly, you have all seen it yourselves; why then have you become completely foolish?
This is the punishment of the evil-doer from God, and the heritage given to the cruel by the Ruler of all.
If his children are increased, it is for the sword; and his offspring have not enough bread.
When those of his house who are still living come to their end by disease, they are not put into the earth, and their widows are not weeping for them.
Though he may get silver together like dust, and make ready great stores of clothing;
He may get them ready, but the upright will put them on, and he who is free from sin will take the silver for a heritage.
His house has no more strength than a spider's thread, or a watchman's tent.
He goes to rest full of wealth, but does so for the last time: on opening his eyes, he sees it there no longer.
Fears overtake him like rushing waters; in the night the storm-wind takes him away.
The east wind takes him up and he is gone; he is forced violently out of his place.
God sends his arrows against him without mercy; he goes in flight before his hand.
Men make signs of joy because of him, driving him from his place with sounds of hissing.
Truly there is a mine for silver, and a place where gold is washed out.
Iron is taken out of the earth, and stone is changed into brass by the fire.
Man puts an end to the dark, searching out to the farthest limit the stones of the deep places of the dark.
He makes a deep mine far away from those living in the light of day ; when they go about on the earth , they have no knowledge of those who are under them , who are hanging far from men , twisting from side to side on a cord
As for the earth, bread comes out of it; but under its face it is turned up as if by fire.
Its stones are the place of sapphires, and it has dust of gold.
No bird has knowledge of it, and the hawk's eye has never seen it.
The great beasts have not gone over it, and the cruel lion has not taken that way.
Man puts out his hand on the hard rock, overturning mountains by the roots.
He makes deep ways, cut through the rock, and his eye sees everything of value.
He keeps back the streams from flowing, and makes the secret things come out into the light.
But where may wisdom be seen? and where is the resting-place of knowledge?
Man has not seen the way to it, and it is not in the land of the living.
The deep waters say, It is not in me: and the sea says, It is not with me.
Gold may not be given for it, or a weight of silver in payment for it.
It may not be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the onyx of great price, or the sapphire.
Gold and glass are not equal to it in price, and it may not be exchanged for jewels of the best gold.
There is no need to say anything about coral or crystal; and the value of wisdom is greater than that of pearls.
The topaz of Ethiopia is not equal to it, and it may not be valued with the best gold.
From where then does wisdom come, and where is the resting-place of knowledge?
For it is kept secret from the eyes of all living, unseen by the birds of the air.
Destruction and Death say, We have only had word of it with our ears.
God has knowledge of the way to it, and of its resting-place;
For his eyes go to the ends of the earth, and he sees everything under heaven.
When he made a weight for the wind, measuring out the waters;
When he made a law for the rain, and a way for the thunder-flames;
Then he saw it, and put it on record; he gave it its fixed form, searching it out completely.
And he said to man, Truly the fear of the Lord is wisdom, and to keep from evil is the way to knowledge.
And Job again took up the word and said,
If only I might again be as I was in the months which are past, in the days when God was watching over me!
When his light was shining over my head, and when I went through the dark by his light.
As I was in my flowering years, when my tent was covered by the hand of God;
While the Ruler of all was still with me, and my children were round me;
When my steps were washed with milk, and rivers of oil were flowing out of the rock for me.
When I went out of my door to go up to the town, and took my seat in the public place,
The young men saw me, and went away, and the old men got up from their seats;
The rulers kept quiet, and put their hands on their mouths;
The chiefs kept back their words, and their tongues were joined to the roofs of their mouths.
For when it came to their ears, men said that I was truly happy; and when their eyes saw, they gave witness to me;
For I was a saviour to the poor when he was crying for help, to the child with no father, and to him who had no supporter.
The blessing of him who was near to destruction came on me, and I put a song of joy into the widow's heart.
I put on righteousness as my clothing, and was full of it; right decisions were to me a robe and a head-dress.
I was eyes to the blind, and feet to him who had no power of walking.
I was a father to the poor, searching out the cause of him who was strange to me.
By me the great teeth of the evil-doer were broken, and I made him give up what he had violently taken away.
Then I said, I will come to my end with my children round me, my days will be as the sand in number;
My root will be open to the waters, and the night mist will be on my branches,
My glory will be ever new, and my bow will be readily bent in my hand.
Men gave ear to me, waiting and keeping quiet for my suggestions.
After I had said what was in my mind, they were quiet and let my words go deep into their hearts;
They were waiting for me as for the rain, opening their mouths wide as for the spring rains.
I was laughing at them when they had no hope, and the light of my face was never clouded by their fear.
I took my place as a chief, guiding them on their way, and I was as a king among his army. ...
Then, opening his mouth, and cursing the day of his birth,
Job made answer and said,
Let destruction take the day of my birth, and the night on which it was said, A man child has come into the world.
That day--let it be dark; let not God take note of it from on high, and let not the light be shining on it;
Let the dark and the black night take it for themselves; let it be covered with a cloud; let the dark shades of day send fear on it.
That night--let the thick dark take it; let it not have joy among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.
As for that night, let it have no fruit; let no voice of joy be sounded in it;
Let it be cursed by those who put a curse on the day; who are ready to make Leviathan awake.
Let its morning stars be dark; let it be looking for light, but may it not have any; let it not see the eyes of the dawn.
Because it did not keep the doors of my mother's body shut, so that trouble might be veiled from my eyes.
Why did death not take me when I came out of my mother's body, why did I not, when I came out, give up my last breath?
Why did the knees take me, or why the breasts that they might give me milk?
For then I might have gone to my rest in quiet, and in sleep have been in peace,
With kings and the wise ones of the earth, who put up great houses for themselves;
Or with rulers who had gold, and whose houses were full of silver;
Or as a child dead at birth I might never have come into existence; like young children who have not seen the light.
There the passions of the evil are over, and those whose strength has come to an end have rest.
There the prisoners are at peace together; the voice of the overseer comes not again to their ears.
The small and the great are there, and the servant is free from his master.
Why does he give light to him who is in trouble, and life to the bitter in soul;
To those whose desire is for death, but it comes not; who are searching for it more than for secret wealth;
Who are glad with great joy, and full of delight when they come to their last resting-place;
To a man whose way is veiled, and who is shut in by God?
In place of my food I have grief, and cries of sorrow come from me like water.
For I have a fear and it comes on me, and my heart is greatly troubled.
I have no peace, no quiet, and no rest; nothing but pain comes on me.
But now those who are younger than I make sport of me; those whose fathers I would not have put with the dogs of my flocks.
Of what use is the strength of their hands to me? all force is gone from them.
They are wasted for need of food, biting the dry earth; their only hope of life is in the waste land.
They are pulling off the salt leaves from the brushwood, and making a meal of roots.
They are sent out from among their townsmen, men are crying after them as thieves
They have to get a resting-place in the hollows of the valleys, in holes of the earth and rocks.
They make noises like asses among the brushwood; they get together under the thorns.
They are sons of shame, and of men without a name, who have been forced out of the land.
And now I have become their song, and I am a word of shame to them.
I am disgusting to them; they keep away from me, and put marks of shame on me.
For he has made loose the cord of my bow, and put me to shame; he has sent down my flag to the earth before me.
The lines of his men of war put themselves in order, and make high their ways of destruction against me:
They have made waste my roads, with a view to my destruction; his bowmen come round about me;
As through a wide broken place in the wall they come on, I am overturned by the shock of their attack.
Fears have come on me; my hope is gone like the wind, and my well-being like a cloud.
But now my soul is turned to water in me, days of trouble overtake me:
The flesh is gone from my bones, and they give me no rest; there is no end to my pains.
With great force he takes a grip of my clothing, pulling me by the neck of my coat.
Truly God has made me low, even to the earth, and I have become like dust.
You give no answer to my cry, and take no note of my prayer.
You have become cruel to me; the strength of your hand is hard on me.
Lifting me up, you make me go on the wings of the wind; I am broken up by the storm.
For I am certain that you will send me back to death, and to the meeting-place ordered for all living.
Has not my hand been stretched out in help to the poor? have I not been a saviour to him in his trouble?
Have I not been weeping for the crushed? and was not my soul sad for him who was in need?
For I was looking for good, and evil came; I was waiting for light, and it became dark.
My feelings are strongly moved, and give me no rest; days of trouble have overtaken me.
I go about in dark clothing, uncomforted; I get up in the public place, crying out for help.
I have become a brother to the jackals, and go about in the company of ostriches.
My skin is black and dropping off me; and my bones are burning with the heat of my disease.
And my music has been turned to sorrow, and the sound of my pipe into the noise of weeping.
I made an agreement with my eyes; how then might my eyes be looking on a virgin?
For what is God's reward from on high, or the heritage given by the Ruler of all from heaven?
Is it not trouble for the sinner, and destruction for the evil-doers?
Does he not see my ways, and are not my steps all numbered?
If I have gone in false ways, or my foot has been quick in working deceit;
(Let me be measured in upright scales, and let God see my righteousness:)
If my steps have been turned out of the way, or if my heart went after my eyes, or if the property of another is in my hands;
Let me put seed in the earth for another to have the fruit of it, and let my produce be uprooted.
If my heart went after another man's wife, or if I was waiting secretly at my neighbour's door;
Then let my wife give pleasure to another man and let others make use of her body.
For that would be a crime; it would be an act for which punishment would be measured out by the judges:
It would be a fire burning even to destruction, and taking away all my produce.
If I did wrong in the cause of my man-servant, or my woman-servant, when they went to law with me;
What then will I do when God comes as my judge? and what answer may I give to his questions?
Did not God make him as well as me? did he not give us life in our mothers' bodies?
If I kept back the desire of the poor; if the widow's eye was looking for help to no purpose;
If I kept my food for myself, and did not give some of it to the child with no father;
(For I was cared for by God as by a father from my earliest days; he was my guide from the body of my mother;)
If I saw one near to death for need of clothing, and that the poor had nothing covering him;
If his back did not give me a blessing, and the wool of my sheep did not make him warm;
If my hand had been lifted up against him who had done no wrong, when I saw that I was supported by the judges;
May my arm be pulled from my body, and be broken from its base.
For the fear of God kept me back, and because of his power I might not do such things.
If I made gold my hope, or if I ever said to the best gold, I have put my faith in you;
If I was glad because my wealth was great, and because my hand had got together a great store;
If, when I saw the sun shining, and the moon moving on its bright way,
A secret feeling of worship came into my heart, and my hand gave kisses from my mouth;
That would have been another sin to be rewarded with punishment by the judges; for I would have been false to God on high.
If I was glad at the trouble of my hater, and gave cries of joy when evil overtook him;
(For I did not let my mouth give way to sin, in putting a curse on his life;)
If the men of my tent did not say, Who has not had full measure of his meat?
The traveller did not take his night's rest in the street, and my doors were open to anyone on a journey;
If I kept my evil doings covered, and my sin in the secret of my breast,
For fear of the great body of people, or for fear that families might make sport of me, so that I kept quiet, and did not go out of my door;
If only God would give ear to me, and the Ruler of all would give me an answer! or if what he has against me had been put in writing!
Truly I would take up the book in my hands; it would be to me as a crown;
I would make clear the number of my steps, I would put it before him like a prince! The words of Job are ended.
If my land has made an outcry against me, or the ploughed earth has been in sorrow;
If I have taken its produce without payment, causing the death of its owners;
Then in place of grain let thorns come up, and in place of barley evil-smelling plants.
So these three men gave no more answers to Job, because he seemed to himself to be right.
And Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was angry, burning with wrath against Job, because he seemed to himself more right than God;
And he was angry with his three friends, because they had been unable to give him an answer, and had not made Job's sin clear.
Now Elihu had kept quiet while Job was talking, because they were older than he;
And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, he was very angry.
And Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, made answer and said, I am young, and you are very old, so I was in fear, and kept myself from putting my knowledge before you.
I said to myself, It is right for the old to say what is in their minds, and for those who are far on in years to give out wisdom.
But truly it is the spirit in man, even the breath of the Ruler of all, which gives them knowledge.
It is not the old who are wise, and those who are full of years have not the knowledge of what is right.
So I say, Give ear to me, and I will put forward my knowledge.
I was waiting for your words, I was giving ear to your wise sayings; while you were searching out what to say,
I was taking note; and truly not one of you was able to make clear Job's error, or to give an answer to his words.
Take care that you do not say, Wisdom is here; God may overcome him, but not man.
I will not put forward words like these, or make use of your sayings in answer to him.
Fear has overcome them, they have no more answers to give; they have come to an end of words.
And am I to go on waiting while they have nothing to say? while they keep quiet and give no more answers?
I will give my answer; I will put forward my knowledge:
For I am full of words, I am unable to keep in my breath any longer:
My stomach is like wine which is unable to get out; like skins full of new wine, it is almost burst.
Let me say what is in my mind, so that I may get comfort; let me give answer with open mouth.
Let me not give respect to any man, or give names of honour to any living.
For I am not able to give names of honour to any man; and if I did, my Maker would quickly take me away.
And now, O Job, give ear to my words, and take note of all I say.
See, now my mouth is open, my tongue gives out words.
My heart is overflowing with knowledge, my lips say what is true.
The spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Ruler of all gives me life.
If you are able, give me an answer; put your cause in order, and come forward.
See, I am the same as you are in the eyes of God; I was cut off from the same bit of wet earth.
Fear of me will not overcome you, and my hand will not be hard on you.
But you said in my hearing, and your voice came to my ears:
I am clean, without sin; I am washed, and there is no evil in me:
See, he is looking for something against me; in his eyes I am as one of his haters;
He puts chains on my feet; he is watching all my ways.
Truly, in saying this you are wrong; for God is greater than man.
Why do you put forward your cause against him, saying, He gives no answer to any of my words?
For God gives his word in one way, even in two, and man is not conscious of it:
In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep comes on men, while they take their rest on their beds;
Then he makes his secrets clear to men, so that they are full of fear at what they see;
In order that man may be turned from his evil works, and that pride may be taken away from him;
To keep back his soul from the underworld, and his life from destruction.
Pain is sent on him as a punishment, while he is on his bed; there is no end to the trouble in his bones;
He has no desire for food, and his soul is turned away from delicate meat;
His flesh is so wasted away, that it may not be seen, and his bones. ...
And his soul comes near to the underworld, and his life to the angels of death.
If now there may be an angel sent to him, one of the thousands which there are to be between him and God, and to make clear to man what is right for him;
And if he has mercy on him, and says, Let him not go down to the underworld, I have given the price for his life:
Then his flesh becomes young again, and he comes back to the days of his early strength;
He makes his prayer to God, and he has mercy on him; he sees God's face with cries of joy; he gives news of his righteousness to men;
He makes a song, saying, I did wrong, turning from the straight way, but he did not give me the reward of my sin.
He kept my soul from the underworld, and my life sees the light in full measure.
Truly, God does all these things to man, twice and three times,
Keeping back his soul from the underworld, so that he may see the light of life.
Take note O Job, give ear to me; keep quiet, while I say what is in my mind.
If you have anything to say, give me an answer; for it is my desire that you may be judged free from sin.
If not, give attention to me, and keep quiet, and I will give you wisdom.
And Elihu made answer and said,
Give ear, you wise, to my words; and you who have knowledge, give attention to me;
For words are tested by the ear, as food is tasted by the mouth.
Let us make the decision for ourselves as to what is right; let us have the knowledge among ourselves of what is good.
For Job has said, I am upright, and it is God who has taken away my right;
Though I am right, still I am in pain; my wound may not be made well, though I have done no wrong.
What man is like Job, a man who freely makes sport of God,
And goes in the company of evil-doers, walking in the way of sinners?
For he has said, It is no profit to a man to take delight in God.
Now then, you wise, take note; you men of knowledge, give ear to me. Let it be far from God to do evil, and from the Ruler of all to do wrong.
For he gives to every man the reward of his work, and sees that he gets the fruit of his ways.
Truly, God does not do evil, and the Ruler of all is not a false judge.
Who put the earth into his care, or made him responsible for the world?
If he made his spirit come back to him, taking his breath into himself again,
All flesh would come to an end together, and man would go back to the dust.
If you are wise, take note of this; give ear to the voice of my words.
How may a hater of right be a ruler? and will you say that the upright Ruler of all is evil?
He who says to a king, You are an evil-doer; and to rulers, You are sinners;
Who has no respect for rulers, and who gives no more attention to those who have wealth than to the poor, for they are all the work of his hands.
Suddenly they come to an end, even in the middle of the night: the blow comes on the men of wealth, and they are gone, and the strong are taken away without the hand of man.
For his eyes are on the ways of a man, and he sees all his steps.
There is no dark place, and no thick cloud, in which the workers of evil may take cover.
For he does not give man a fixed time to come before him to be judged.
He sends the strong to destruction without searching out their cause, and puts others in their place.
For he has knowledge of their works, overturning them in the night, so that they are crushed.
The evil-doers are broken by his wrath, he puts his hand on them with force before the eyes of all onlookers.
Because they did not go after him, and took no note of his ways,
So that the cry of the poor might come up to him, and the prayer of those in need come to his ears.
...
...
...
...
...
Men of knowledge, and all wise men, hearing me, will say,
Job's words do not come from knowledge; they are not the fruit of wisdom.
May Job be tested to the end, because his answers have been like those of evil men.
For in addition to his sin, he is uncontrolled in heart; before our eyes he makes sport of God, increasing his words against him.
And Elihu made answer and said,
Does it seem to you to be right, and righteousness before God, to say,
What profit is it to me, and how am I better off than if I had done wrong?
I will make answer to you and to your friends:
Let your eyes be turned to the heavens, and lifted up to see the skies; they are higher than you.
If you have done wrong, is he any the worse for it? and if your sins are great in number, what is it to him?
If you are upright, what do you give to him? or what does he take from your hand?
Your evil-doing may have an effect on a man like yourself, or your righteousness on a son of man.
Because the hand of the cruel is hard on them, men are making sounds of grief; they are crying out for help because of the arm of the strong.
But no one has said, Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night;
Who gives us more knowledge than the beasts of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the heaven?
There they are crying out because of the pride of the evil-doers, but he gives them no answer.
But God will not give ear to what is false, or the Ruler of all take note of it;
How much less when you say that you do not see him; that the cause is before him, and you are waiting for him.
And now ... ;
And Job's mouth is open wide to give out what is of no profit, increasing words without knowledge.
And Elihu went on to say,
Give me a little more time, and I will make it clear to you; for I have still something to say for God.
I will get my knowledge from far, and I will give righteousness to my Maker.
For truly my words are not false; one who has all knowledge is talking with you.
Truly, God gives up the hard-hearted, and will not give life to the sinner.
His eyes are ever on the upright, and he gives to the crushed their right;
Lifting them up to the seat of kings, and making them safe for ever.
And if they have been prisoned in chains, and taken in cords of trouble,
Then he makes clear to them what they have done, even their evil works in which they have taken pride.
Their ear is open to his teaching, and he gives them orders so that their hearts may be turned from evil.
If they give ear to his voice, and do his word, then he gives them long life, and years full of pleasure.
But if not, they come to their end, and give up their breath without knowledge.
Those who have no fear of God keep wrath stored up in their hearts; they give no cry for help when they are made prisoners.
They come to their end while they are still young, their life is short like that of those who are used for sex purposes in the worship of their gods.
He makes the wrong done to the poor the way of their salvation, opening their ears by their trouble.
...
...
...
...
...
Take care not to be turned to sin, for you have taken evil for your part in place of sorrow.
Truly God is lifted up in strength; who is a ruler like him?
Who ever gave orders to him, or said to him, You have done wrong?
See that you give praise to his work, about which men make songs.
All people are looking on it; man sees it from far.
Truly, God is great, greater than all our knowledge; the number of his years may not be searched out.
For he takes up the drops from the sea; he sends them through his mist as rain,
Flowing down from the sky, and dropping on the peoples.
And who has knowledge of how the clouds are stretched out, or of the thunders of his tent?
See, he is stretching out his mist, covering the tops of the mountains with it.
For by these he gives food to the peoples, and bread in full measure.
He takes the light in his hands, sending it against the mark.
The thunder makes clear his passion, and the storm gives news of his wrath.
At this my heart is shaking; it is moved out of its place.
Give ear to the rolling noise of his voice; to the hollow sound which goes out of his mouth.
He sends it out through all the heaven, and his thunder-flame to the ends of the earth.
After it a voice is sounding, thundering out the word of his power; he does not keep back his thunder-flames; from his mouth his voice is sounding.
He does wonders, more than may be searched out; great things of which we have no knowledge;
For he says to the snow, Make the earth wet; and to the rain-storm, Come down.
He puts an end to the work of every man, so that all may see his work.
Then the beasts go into their holes, and take their rest.
Out of its place comes the storm-wind, and the cold out of its store-houses.
By the breath of God ice is made, and the wide waters are shut in.
The thick cloud is weighted with thunder-flame, and the cloud sends out its light;
And it goes this way and that, round about, turning itself by his guiding, to do whatever he gives orders to be done, on the face of his world of men,
For a rod, or for a curse, or for mercy, causing it to come on the mark.
Give ear to this, O Job, and keep quiet in your place; and take note of the wonders worked by God.
Have you knowledge of God's ordering of his works, how he makes the light of his cloud to be seen?
Have you knowledge of the balancings of the clouds, the wonders of him who has all wisdom?
You, whose clothing is warm, when the earth is quiet because of the south wind,
Will you, with him, make the skies smooth, and strong as a polished looking-glass?
Make clear to me what we are to say to him; we are unable to put our cause before him, because of the dark.
How may he have knowledge of my desire for talk with him? or did any man ever say, May destruction come on me?
And now the light is not seen, for it is dark because of the clouds; but a wind comes, clearing them away.
A bright light comes out of the north; God's glory is greatly to be feared.
There is no searching out of the Ruler of all: his strength and his judging are great; he is full of righteousness, doing no wrong.
For this cause men go in fear of him; he has no respect for any who are wise in heart.
And the Lord made answer to Job out of the storm-wind, and said,
Who is this who makes the purpose of God dark by words without knowledge?
Get your strength together like a man of war; I will put questions to you, and you will give me the answers.
Where were you when I put the earth on its base? Say, if you have knowledge.
By whom were its measures fixed? Say, if you have wisdom; or by whom was the line stretched out over it?
On what were its pillars based, or who put down its angle-stone,
When the morning stars made songs together, and all the sons of the gods gave cries of joy?
Or where were you when the sea came to birth, pushing out from its secret place;
When I made the cloud its robe, and put thick clouds as bands round it,
Ordering a fixed limit for it, with locks and doors;
And said, So far you may come, and no farther; and here the pride of your waves will be stopped?
Have you, from your earliest days, given orders to the morning, or made the dawn conscious of its place;
So that it might take a grip of the skirts of the earth, shaking all the evil-doers out of it?
It is changed like wet earth under a stamp, and is coloured like a robe;
And from the evil-doers their light is kept back, and the arm of pride is broken.
Have you come into the springs of the sea, walking in the secret places of the deep?
Have the doors of death been open to you, or have the door-keepers of the dark ever seen you?
Have you taken note of the wide limits of the earth? Say, if you have knowledge of it all.
Which is the way to the resting-place of the light, and where is the store-house of the dark;
So that you might take it to its limit, guiding it to its house?
No doubt you have knowledge of it, for then you had come to birth, and the number of your days is great.
Have you come into the secret place of snow, or have you seen the store-houses of the ice-drops,
Which I have kept for the time of trouble, for the day of war and fighting?
Which is the way to the place where the wind is measured out, and the east wind sent out over the earth?
By whom has the way been cut for the flowing of the rain, and the flaming of the thunder;
Causing rain to come on a land where no man is living, on the waste land which has no people;
To give water to the land where there is waste and destruction, and to make the dry land green with young grass?
Has the rain a father? or who gave birth to the drops of night mist?
Out of whose body came the ice? and who gave birth to the cold mist of heaven?
The waters are joined together, hard as a stone, and the face of the deep is covered.
Are the bands of the Pleiades fixed by you, or are the cords of Orion made loose?
Do you make Mazzaroth come out in its right time, or are the Bear and its children guided by you?
Have you knowledge of the laws of the heavens? did you give them rule over the earth?
Is your voice sent up to the cloud, so that you may be covered by the weight of waters?
Do you send out the thunder-flames, so that they may go, and say to you, Here we are?
Who has put wisdom in the high clouds, or given knowledge to the lights of the north?
By whose wisdom are the clouds numbered, or the water-skins of the heavens turned to the earth,
When the earth becomes hard as metal, and is joined together in masses?
Do you go after food for the she-lion, or get meat so that the young lions may have enough,
When they are stretched out in their holes, and are waiting in the brushwood?
Who gives in the evening the meat he is searching for, when his young ones are crying to God; when the young lions with loud noise go wandering after their food?
Have you knowledge of the rock-goats? or do you see the roes giving birth to their young?
Is the number of their months fixed by you? or is the time when they give birth ordered by you?
They are bent down, they give birth to their young, they let loose the fruit of their body.
Their young ones are strong, living in the open country; they go out and do not come back again.
Who has let the ass of the fields go free? or made loose the bands of the loud-voiced beast?
To whom I have given the waste land for a heritage, and the salt land as a living-place.
He makes sport of the noise of the town; the voice of the driver does not come to his ears;
He goes looking for his grass-lands in the mountains, searching out every green thing.
Will the ox of the mountains be your servant? or is his night's resting-place by your food-store?
Will he be pulling your plough with cords, turning up the valleys after you?
Will you put your faith in him, because his strength is great? will you give the fruit of your work into his care?
Will you be looking for him to come back, and get in your seed to the crushing-floor?
Is the wing of the ostrich feeble, or is it because she has no feathers,
That she puts her eggs on the earth, warming them in the dust,
Without a thought that they may be crushed by the foot, and broken by the beasts of the field?
She is cruel to her young ones, as if they were not hers; her work is to no purpose; she has no fear.
For God has taken wisdom from her mind, and given her no measure of knowledge.
When she is shaking her wings on high, she makes sport of the horse and of him who is seated on him.
Do you give strength to the horse? is it by your hand that his neck is clothed with power?
Is it through you that he is shaking like a locust, in the pride of his loud-sounding breath?
He is stamping with joy in the valley; he makes sport of fear.
In his strength he goes out against the arms of war, turning not away from the sword.
The bow is sounding against him; he sees the shining point of spear and arrow.
Shaking with passion, he is biting the earth; he is not able to keep quiet at the sound of the horn;
When it comes to his ears he says, Aha! He is smelling the fight from far off, and hearing the thunder of the captains, and the war-cries.
Is it through your knowledge that the hawk takes his flight, stretching out his wings to the south?
Or is it by your orders that the eagle goes up, and makes his resting-place on high?
On the rock is his house, and on the mountain-top his strong place.
From there he is watching for food; his eye sees it far off.
His young have blood for their drink, and where the dead bodies are, there is he to be seen.
And Eliphaz the Temanite made answer and said,
If one says a word, will it be a weariness to you? but who is able to keep from saying what is in his mind?
Truly, you have been a helper to others, and you have made feeble hands strong;
He who was near to falling has been lifted up by your words, and you have given strength to bent knees.
But now it has come on you and it is a weariness to you; you are touched by it and your mind is troubled.
Is not your fear of God your support, and your upright way of life your hope?
Have you ever seen destruction come to an upright man? or when were the god-fearing ever cut off?
What I have seen is that those by whom trouble has been ploughed, and evil planted, get the same for themselves.
By the breath of God destruction takes them, and by the wind of his wrath they are cut off.
Though the noise of the lion and the sounding of his voice, may be loud, the teeth of the young lions are broken.
The old lion comes to his end for need of food, and the young of the she-lion go wandering in all directions.
A word was given to me secretly, and the low sound of it came to my ears.
In troubled thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep comes on men,
Fear came on me and shaking, and my bones were full of trouble;
And a breath was moving over my face; the hair of my flesh became stiff:
Something was present before me, but I was not able to see it clearly; there was a form before my eyes: a quiet voice came to my ears, saying:
May a man be upright before God? or a man be clean before his Maker?
Truly, he puts no faith in his servants, and he sees error in his angels;
How much more those living in houses of earth, whose bases are in the dust! They are crushed more quickly than an insect;
Between morning and evening they are completely broken; they come to an end for ever, and no one takes note.
If their tent-cord is pulled up, do they not come to an end, and without wisdom?
...
Will he who is protesting give teaching to the Ruler of all? Let him who has arguments to put forward against God give an answer.
And Job said in answer to the Lord,
Truly, I am of no value; what answer may I give to you? I will put my hand on my mouth.
I have said once, and even twice, what was in my mind, but I will not do so again.
Then the Lord made answer to Job out of the storm-wind, and said,
Get your strength together like a man of war: I will put questions to you, and you will give me the answers.
Will you even make my right of no value? will you say that I am wrong in order to make clear that you are right?
Have you an arm like God? have you a voice of thunder like his?
Put on the ornaments of your pride; be clothed with glory and power:
Let your wrath be overflowing; let your eyes see all the sons of pride, and make them low.
Send destruction on all who are lifted up, pulling down the sinners from their places.
Let them be covered together in the dust; let their faces be dark in the secret place of the underworld.
Then I will give praise to you, saying that your right hand is able to give you salvation.
See now the Great Beast, whom I made, even as I made you; he takes grass for food, like the ox.
His strength is in his body, and his force in the muscles of his stomach.
His tail is curving like a cedar; the muscles of his legs are joined together.
His bones are pipes of brass, his legs are like rods of iron.
He is the chief of the ways of God, made by him for his pleasure.
He takes the produce of the mountains, where all the beasts of the field are at play.
He takes his rest under the trees of the river, and in the pool, under the shade of the water-plants.
He is covered by the branches of the trees; the grasses of the stream are round him.
Truly, if the river is overflowing, it gives him no cause for fear; he has no sense of danger, even if Jordan is rushing against his mouth.
Will anyone take him when he is on the watch, or put metal teeth through his nose?
Is it possible for Leviathan to be pulled out with a fish-hook, or for a hook to be put through the bone of his mouth?
Will you put a cord into his nose, or take him away with a cord round his tongue?
Will he make prayers to you, or say soft words to you?
Will he make an agreement with you, so that you may take him as a servant for ever?
Will you make sport with him, as with a bird? or put him in chains for your young women?
Will the fishermen make profit out of him? will they have him cut up for the traders?
Will you put sharp-pointed irons into his skin, or fish-spears into his head?
Only put your hand on him, and see what a fight you will have; you will not do it again!
Truly, the hope of his attacker is false; he is overcome even on seeing him!
He is so cruel that no one is ready to go against him. Who then is able to keep his place before me?
Who ever went against me, and got the better of me? There is no one under heaven!
I will not keep quiet about the parts of his body, or about his power, and the strength of his frame.
Who has ever taken off his outer skin? who may come inside his inner coat of iron?
Who has made open the doors of his face? Fear is round about his teeth.
His back is made of lines of plates, joined tight together, one against the other, like a stamp.
One is so near to the other that no air may come between them.
They take a grip of one another; they are joined together, so that they may not be parted.
His sneezings give out flames, and his eyes are like the eyes of the dawn.
Out of his mouth go burning lights, and flames of fire are jumping up.
Smoke comes out of his nose, like a pot boiling on the fire.
His breath puts fire to coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.
Strength is in his neck, and fear goes dancing before him.
The plates of his flesh are joined together, fixed, and not to be moved.
His heart is as strong as a stone, hard as the lower crushing-stone.
When he gets ready for the fight, the strong are overcome with fear.
The sword may come near him but is not able to go through him; the spear, or the arrow, or the sharp-pointed iron.
Iron is to him as dry grass, and brass as soft wood.
The arrow is not able to put him to flight: stones are no more to him than dry stems.
A thick stick is no better than a leaf of grass, and he makes sport of the onrush of the spear.
Under him are sharp edges of broken pots: as if he was pulling a grain-crushing instrument over the wet earth.
The deep is boiling like a pot of spices, and the sea like a perfume-vessel.
After him his way is shining, so that the deep seems white.
On earth there is not another like him, who is made without fear.
Everything which is high goes in fear of him; he is king over all the sons of pride.
And Job said in answer to the Lord,
I see that you are able to do every thing, and to give effect to all your designs.
Who is this who makes dark the purpose of God by words without knowledge? For I have been talking without knowledge about wonders not to be searched out.
Give ear to me, and I will say what is in my mind; I will put questions to you, and you will give me the answers.
Word of you had come to my ears, but now my eye has seen you.
For this cause I give witness that what I said is false, and in sorrow I take my seat in the dust.
And it came about , after he had said these words to Job , that the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite , I am very angry with you and your two friends , because you have not said what is right about me , as my servant Job has
And now , take seven oxen and seven sheep , and go to my servant Job , and give a burned offering for yourselves , and my servant Job will make prayer for you , that I may not send punishment on you ; because you have not said what
is right about me , as my servant Job has .
And Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, went and did as the Lord had said. And the Lord gave ear to Job.
And the Lord made up to Job for all his losses, after he had made prayer for his friends: and all Job had before was increased by the Lord twice as much.
And all his brothers and sisters , and his friends of earlier days , came and took food with him in his house ; and made clear their grief for him , and gave him comfort for all the evil which the Lord had sent on him ; and they
all gave him a bit of money and a gold ring .
And the Lord's blessing was greater on the end of Job's life than on its start: and so he came to have fourteen thousand sheep and goats, and six thousand camels, and two thousand oxen, and a thousand she-asses.
And he had seven sons and three daughters.
And he gave the first the name of Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch;
And there were no women so beautiful as the daughters of Job in all the earth: and their father gave them a heritage among their brothers.
And after this Job had a hundred and forty years of life, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.
And Job came to his end, old and full of days.
Give now a cry for help; is there anyone who will give you an answer? and to which of the holy ones will you make your prayer?
For wrath is the cause of death to the foolish, and he who has no wisdom comes to his end through passion.
I have seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly the curse came on his house.
Now his children have no safe place, and they are crushed before the judges, for no one takes up their cause.
Their produce is taken by him who has no food, and their grain goes to the poor, and he who is in need of water gets it from their spring.
For evil does not come out of the dust, or trouble out of the earth;
But trouble is man's fate from birth, as the flames go up from the fire.
But as for me, I would make my prayer to God, and I would put my cause before him:
Who does great things outside our knowledge, wonders without number:
Who gives rain on the earth, and sends water on the fields:
Lifting up those who are low, and putting the sad in a safe place;
Who makes the designs of the wise go wrong, so that they are unable to give effect to their purposes.
He takes the wise in their secret designs, and the purposes of the twisted are cut off suddenly.
In the daytime it becomes dark for them, and in the sunlight they go feeling about as if it was night.
But he keeps safe from their sword those who have no father, and the poor from the power of the strong.
So the poor man has hope, and the mouth of the evil-doer is stopped.
Truly, that man is happy who has training from the hand of God: so do not let your heart be shut to the teaching of the Ruler of all.
For after his punishment he gives comfort, and after wounding, his hands make you well.
He will keep you safe from six troubles, and in seven no evil will come near you.
When there is need of food he will keep you from death, and in war from the power of the sword.
He will keep you safe from the evil tongue; and you will have no fear of wasting when it comes.
You will make sport of destruction and need, and will have no fear of the beasts of the earth.
For you will be in agreement with the stones of the earth, and the beasts of the field will be at peace with you.
And you will be certain that your tent is at peace, and after looking over your property you will see that nothing is gone.
You will be certain that your seed will be great, and your offspring like the plants of the earth.
You will come to your last resting-place in full strength, as the grain is taken up to the crushing-floor in its time.
See, we have made search with care, and it is so; it has come to our ears; see that you take note of it for yourself.
And Job made answer and said,
If only my passion might be measured, and put into the scales against my trouble!
For then its weight would be more than the sand of the seas: because of this my words have been uncontrolled.
For the arrows of the Ruler of all are present with me, and their poison goes deep into my spirit: his army of fears is put in order against me.
Does the ass of the fields give out his voice when he has grass? or does the ox make sounds over his food?
Will a man take food which has no taste without salt? or is there any taste in the soft substance of purslain?
My soul has no desire for such things, they are as disease in my food.
If only I might have an answer to my prayer, and God would give me my desire!
If only he would be pleased to put an end to me; and would let loose his hand, so that I might be cut off!
So I would still have comfort, and I would have joy in the pains of death, for I have not been false to the words of the Holy One.
Have I strength to go on waiting, or have I any end to be looking forward to?
Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh brass?
I have no help in myself, and wisdom is completely gone from me.
He whose heart is shut against his friend has given up the fear of the Ruler of all.
My friends have been false like a stream, like streams in the valleys which come to an end:
Which are dark because of the ice, and the snow falling into them;
Under the burning sun they are cut off, and come to nothing because of the heat.
The camel-trains go out of their way; they go up into the waste and come to destruction.
The camel-trains of Tema were searching with care, the bands of Sheba were waiting for them:
They were put to shame because of their hope; they came and their hope was gone.
So have you now become to me; you see my sad condition and are in fear.
Did I say, Give me something? or, Make a payment for me out of your wealth?
Or, Get me out of the power of my hater? or, Give money so that I may be free from the power of the cruel ones?
Give me teaching and I will be quiet; and make me see my error.
How pleasing are upright words! but what force is there in your arguments?
My words may seem wrong to you, but the words of him who has no hope are for the wind.
Truly, you are such as would give up the child of a dead man to his creditors, and would make a profit out of your friend.
Now then, let your eyes be turned to me, for truly I will not say what is false to your face.
Let your minds be changed, and do not have an evil opinion of me; yes, be changed, for my righteousness is still in me.
Is there evil in my tongue? is not the cause of my trouble clear to me?
Has not man his ordered time of trouble on the earth? and are not his days like the days of a servant working for payment?
As a servant desiring the shades of evening, and a workman looking for his payment:
So I have for my heritage months of pain to no purpose, and nights of weariness are given to me.
When I go to my bed, I say, When will it be time to get up? but the night is long, and I am turning from side to side till morning light.
My flesh is covered with worms and dust; my skin gets hard and then is cracked again.
My days go quicker than the cloth-worker's thread, and come to an end without hope.
O, keep in mind that my life is wind: my eye will never again see good.
The eye of him who sees me will see me no longer: your eyes will be looking for me, but I will be gone.
A cloud comes to an end and is gone; so he who goes down into the underworld comes not up again.
He will not come back to his house, and his place will have no more knowledge of him.
So I will not keep my mouth shut; I will let the words come from it in the pain of my spirit, my soul will make a bitter outcry.
Am I a sea, or a sea-beast, that you put a watch over me?
When I say, In my bed I will have comfort, there I will get rest from my disease;
Then you send dreams to me, and visions of fear;
So that a hard death seems better to my soul than my pains.
I have no desire for life, I would not be living for ever! Keep away from me, for my days are as a breath.
What is man, that you have made him great, and that your attention is fixed on him,
And that your hand is on him every morning, and that you are testing him every minute?
How long will it be before your eyes are turned away from me, so that I may have a minute's breathing-space?
If I have done wrong, what have I done to you, O keeper of men? why have you made me a mark for your blows, so that I am a weariness to myself?
And why do you not take away my sin, and let my wrongdoing be ended? for now I go down to the dust, and you will be searching for me with care, but I will be gone.
Then Bildad the Shuhite made answer and said,
How long will you say these things, and how long will the words of your mouth be like a strong wind?
Does God give wrong decisions? or is the Ruler of all not upright in his judging?
If your children have done evil against him, then their punishment is from his hand.
If you will make search for God with care, and put your request before the Ruler of all;
If you are clean and upright; then he will certainly be moved to take up your cause, and will make clear your righteousness by building up your house again.
And though your start was small, your end will be very great.
Put the question now to the past generations, and give attention to what has been searched out by their fathers:
(For we are but of yesterday, and have no knowledge, because our days on earth are gone like a shade:)
Will they not give you teaching, and say words of wisdom to you?
Will the river-plant come up in its pride without wet earth? will the grass get tall without water?
When it is still green, without being cut down, it becomes dry and dead before any other plant.
So is the end of all who do not keep God in mind; and the hope of the evil-doer comes to nothing:
Whose support is cut off, and whose hope is no stronger than a spider's thread.
He is looking to his family for support, but it is not there; he puts his hope in it, but it comes to nothing.
He is full of strength before the sun, and his branches go out over his garden.
His roots are twisted round the stones, forcing their way in between them.
If he is taken away from his place, then it will say, I have not seen you.
Such is the joy of his way, and out of the dust another comes up to take his place.
Truly, God will not give up him who is without sin, and will not take evil-doers by the hand.
The time will come when your mouth will be full of laughing, and cries of joy will come from your lips.
Your haters will be clothed with shame, and the tent of the sinner will not be seen again.
And Job made answer and said,
Truly, I see that it is so: and how is it possible for a man to get his right before God?
If a man was desiring to go to law with him, he would not be able to give him an answer to one out of a thousand questions.
He is wise in heart and great in strength: who ever made his face hard against him, and any good came of it?
It is he who takes away the mountains without their knowledge, overturning them in his wrath:
Who is moving the earth out of its place, so that its pillars are shaking:
Who gives orders to the sun, and it does not give its light; and who keeps the stars from shining.
By whose hand the heavens were stretched out, and who is walking on the waves of the sea:
Who made the Bear and Orion, and the Pleiades, and the store-houses of the south:
Who does great things not to be searched out; yes, wonders without number.
See, he goes past me and I see him not: he goes on before, but I have no knowledge of him.
If he puts out his hand to take, by whom may it be turned back? who may say to him, What are you doing?
God's wrath may not be turned back; the helpers of Rahab were bent down under him.
How much less may I give an answer to him, using the right words in argument with him?
Even if my cause was good, I would not be able to give an answer; I would make request for grace from him who was against me.
If I had sent for him to be present, and he had come, I would have no faith that he would give ear to my voice.
For I would be crushed by his storm, my wounds would be increased without cause.
He would not let me take my breath, but I would be full of bitter grief.
If it is a question of strength, he says, Here I am! and if it is a question of a cause at law, he says, Who will give me a fixed day?
Though I was in the right, he would say that I was in the wrong; I have done no evil; but he says that I am a sinner.
I have done no wrong; I give no thought to what becomes of me; I have no desire for life.
It is all the same to me; so I say, He puts an end to the sinner and to him who has done no wrong together.
If death comes suddenly through disease, he makes sport of the fate of those who have done no wrong.
The land is given into the power of the evil-doer; the faces of its judges are covered; if not by him, then who has done it?
My days go quicker than a post-runner: they go in flight, they see no good.
They go rushing on like reed-boats, like an eagle dropping suddenly on its food.
If I say, I will put my grief out of mind, I will let my face be sad no longer and I will be bright;
I go in fear of all my pains; I am certain that I will not be free from sin in your eyes.
You will not let me be clear of sin! why then do I take trouble for nothing?
If I am washed with snow water, and make my hands clean with soap;
Then you will have me pushed into the dust, so that I will seem disgusting to my very clothing.
For he is not a man as I am, that I might give him an answer, that we might come together before a judge.
There is no one to give a decision between us, who might have control over us.
Let him take away his rod from me and not send his fear on me:
Then I would say what is in my mind without fear of him; for there is no cause of fear in myself.
The word of the Lord which came to Joel, the son of Pethuel.
Give ear to this, you old men, and take note, you people of the land. Has this ever been in your days, or in the days of your fathers?
Give the story of it to your children, and let them give it to their children, and their children to another generation.
What the worm did not make a meal of, has been taken by the locust; and what the locust did not take, has been food for the plant-worm; and what the plant-worm did not take, has been food for the field-fly.
Come out of your sleep, you who are overcome with wine, and give yourselves to weeping; give cries of sorrow, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine; for it has been cut off from your mouths.
For a nation has come up over my land, strong and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he has the back teeth of a great lion.
By him my vine is made waste and my fig-tree broken: he has taken all its fruit and sent it down to the earth; its branches are made white.
Make sounds of grief like a virgin dressed in haircloth for the husband of her early years.
The meal offering and the drink offering have been cut off from the house of the Lord; the priests, the Lord's servants, are sorrowing.
The fields are wasted, the land has become dry; for the grain is wasted, the new wine is kept back, the oil is poor.
The farmers are shamed, the workers in the vine-gardens give cries of grief, for the wheat and the barley; for the produce of the fields has come to destruction.
The vine has become dry and the fig-tree is feeble; the pomegranate and the palm-tree and the apple-tree, even all the trees of the field, are dry: because joy has gone from the sons of men.
Put haircloth round you and give yourselves to sorrow , you priests ; give cries of grief , you servants of the altar : come in , and , clothed in haircloth , let the night go past , you servants of my God : for the meal offering and
the drink offering have been kept back from the house of your God .
Let a time be fixed for going without food, have a holy meeting, let the old men, even all the people of the land, come together to the house of the Lord your God, crying out to the Lord.
Sorrow for the day! for the day of the Lord is near, and as destruction from the Ruler of all it will come.
Is not food cut off before our eyes? joy and delight from the house of our God?
The grains have become small and dry under the spade; the store-houses are made waste, the grain-stores are broken down; for the grain is dry and dead.
What sounds of pain come from the beasts! the herds of cattle are at a loss because there is no grass for them; even the flocks of sheep are no longer to be seen.
O Lord, my cry goes up to you: for fire has put an end to the grass-lands of the waste, and all the trees of the field are burned with its flame.
The beasts of the field are turning to you with desire: for the water-streams are dry and fire has put an end to the grass-lands of the waste.
Let the horn be sounded in Zion, and a war-cry in my holy mountain; let all the people of the land be troubled: for the day of the Lord is coming;
For a day of dark and deep shade is near , a day of cloud and black night : like a black cloud a great and strong people is covering the mountains ; there has never been any like them and will not be after them again , from generation
to generation .
Before them fire sends destruction, and after them flame is burning: the land is like the garden of Eden before them, and after them an unpeopled waste; truly, nothing has been kept safe from them.
Their form is like the form of horses, and they are running like war-horses.
Like the sound of war-carriages they go jumping on the tops of the mountains; like the noise of a flame of fire burning up the grain-stems, like a strong people lined up for the fight.
At their coming the people are bent with pain: all faces become red together.
They are running like strong men, they go over the wall like men of war; every man goes straight on his way, their lines are not broken.
No one is pushing against another; everyone goes straight on his way: bursting through the sword points, their order is not broken.
They make a rush on the town, running on the wall; they go up into the houses and in through the windows like a thief.
The earth is troubled before them and the heavens are shaking: the sun and the moon have become dark, and the stars keep back their shining:
And the Lord is thundering before his forces; for very great is his army; for he is strong who gives effect to his word: for the day of the Lord is great and greatly to be feared, and who has strength against it?
But even now, says the Lord, come back to me with all your heart, keeping from food, with weeping and with sorrow:
Let your hearts be broken, and not your clothing, and come back to the Lord your God: for he is full of grace and pity, slow to be angry and great in mercy, ready to be turned from his purpose of punishment.
May it not be that he will again let his purpose be changed and let a blessing come after him, even a meal offering and a drink offering for the Lord your God?
Let a horn be sounded in Zion, let a time be fixed for going without food, have a holy meeting:
Get the people together, make the mass of the people holy, send for the old men, get together the children and babies at the breast: let the newly married man come out of his room and the bride from her tent.
Let the priests , the servants of the Lord , be weeping between the covered way and the altar , and let them say , Have mercy on your people , O Lord , do not give up your heritage to shame , so that the nations become their rulers
: why let them say among the peoples , Where is their God ?
Then the Lord had a care for the honour of his land and had pity on his people.
And the Lord made answer and said to his people, See, I will send you grain and wine and oil in full measure: and I will no longer let you be shamed among the nations:
I will send the one from the north far away from you , driving him into a dry and waste land , with his front to the sea of the east and his back to the sea of the west , and the smell of him will go up ,
even his evil smell will go up .
Have no fear, O land; be glad with great joy; for the Lord has done great things.
Have no fear, you beasts of the field, for the grass-lands of the waste are becoming green, for the trees are producing fruit, the fig-tree and the vine give out their strength.
Be glad, then, you children of Zion, and have joy in the Lord your God: for he gives you food in full measure, making the rain come down for you, the early and the late rain as at the first.
And the floors will be full of grain, and the crushing-places overflowing with wine and oil.
I will give back to you the years which were food for the locust, the plant-worm, the field-fly, and the worm, my great army which I sent among you.
You will have food in full measure, and give praise to the name of the Lord your God, who has done wonders for you:
And you will be certain that I am in Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and there is no other: and my people will never be shamed.
And after that, it will come about, says the Lord, that I will send my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters will be prophets, your old men will have dreams, your young men will see visions:
And on the servants and the servant-girls in those days I will send my spirit.
And I will let wonders be seen in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and pillars of smoke.
The sun will be made dark and the moon turned to blood, before the great day of the Lord comes, a day to be feared.
And it will be that whoever makes his prayer to the name of the Lord will be kept safe : for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem some will be kept safe , as the Lord has said , and will be among the small band marked out by the
Lord .
For in those days and in that time, when I let the fate of Judah and Jerusalem be changed,
I will get together all the nations , and make them come down into the valley of Jehoshaphat ; and there I will take up with them the cause of my people and of my heritage Israel , whom they have sent wandering among the nations , and of my
land which has been parted by them .
And they have put the fate of my people to the decision of chance: giving a boy for the price of a loose woman and a girl for a drink of wine.
And further, what are you to me, O Tyre and Zidon and all the circle of Philistia? will you give me back any payment? and if you do, quickly and suddenly I will send it back on your head,
For you have taken my silver and my gold, putting in the houses of your gods my beautiful and pleasing things.
And the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem you have given for a price to the sons of the Greeks, to send them far away from their land:
See, I will have them moved from the place where you have sent them, and will let what you have done come back on your head;
I will give your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah for a price, and they will give them for a price to the men of Sheba, a nation far off: for the Lord has said it.
Give this out among the nations; make ready for war: get the strong men awake; let all the men of war come near, let them come up.
Get your plough-blades hammered into swords, and your vine-knives into spears: let the feeble say, I am strong.
Come quickly, all you nations round about, and get yourselves together there: make your strong ones come down, O Lord.
Let the nations be awake, and come to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there I will be seated as judge of all the nations round about.
Put in the blade, for the grain is ready: come, get you down, for the wine-crusher is full, the vessels are overflowing; for great is their evil-doing.
Masses on masses in the valley of decision! for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.
The sun and the moon have become dark, and the stars keep back their shining.
And the Lord will be thundering from Zion, and his voice will be sounding from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth will be shaking: but the Lord will be a breastplate for his people and a strong place for the children of Israel.
And you will be certain that I am the Lord your God, living in Zion, my holy mountain: and Jerusalem will be holy, and no strange person will ever again go through her.
And it will come about in that day that the mountains will be dropping sweet wine , and the hills will be flowing with milk , and all the streams of Judah will be flowing with water ; and a fountain will come out from the house of the Lord
, watering the valley of acacia-trees .
Egypt will be a waste and Edom a land of destruction, because of the evil done to the children of Judah, because they have let blood be drained out in their land without cause.
But Judah will be peopled for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
And I will send punishment for their blood, for which punishment has not been sent, for the Lord is living in Zion.
And the word of the Lord came to Jonah, the son of Amittai, saying,
Up! go to Nineveh, that great town, and let your voice come to it; for their evil-doing has come up before me.
And Jonah got up to go in flight to Tarshish , away from the Lord ; and he went down to Joppa , and saw there a ship going to Tarshish : so he gave them the price of the journey and went down into it to go with them
to Tarshish , away from the Lord .
And the Lord sent out a great wind on to the sea and there was a violent storm in the sea, so that the ship seemed in danger of being broken.
Then the sailors were full of fear , every man crying to his god ; and the goods in the ship were dropped out into the sea to make the weight less . But Jonah had gone down into the inmost part of the ship where he was stretched out
in a deep sleep .
And the ship's captain came to him and said to him, What are you doing sleeping? Up! say a prayer to your God, if by chance God will give a thought to us, so that we may not come to destruction.
And they said to one another, Come, let us put this to the decision of chance and see on whose account this evil has come on us. So they did so, and Jonah was seen to be the man.
Then they said to him, Now make clear to us what is your work, and where you come from? what is your country, and who are your people?
And he said to them, I am a Hebrew, a worshipper of the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.
And the men were in great fear, and they said to him, What is this you have done? For the men had knowledge of his flight from the Lord because he had not kept it from them.
And they said to him, What are we to do to you so that the sea may become calm for us? For the sea was getting rougher and rougher.
And he said to them, Take me up and put me into the sea, and the sea will become calm for you: for I am certain that because of me this great storm has come on you.
And the men were working hard to get back to the land, but they were not able to do so: for the sea got rougher and rougher against them.
So , crying to the Lord , they said , Give ear to our prayer , O Lord , give ear , and do not let destruction overtake us because of this man ' s life ; do not put on us the sin of taking life without cause :
for you , O Lord , have done what seemed good to you .
So they took Jonah up and put him into the sea: and the sea was no longer angry.
Then great was the men's fear of the Lord; and they made an offering to the Lord and took oaths to him.
And the Lord made ready a great fish to take Jonah into its mouth; and Jonah was inside the fish for three days and three nights.
Then Jonah made prayer to the Lord his God from the inside of the fish, and said,
In my trouble I was crying to the Lord, and he gave me an answer; out of the deepest underworld I sent up a cry, and you gave ear to my voice.
For you have put me down into the deep, into the heart of the sea; and the river was round about me; all your waves and your rolling waters went over me.
And I said, I have been sent away from before your eyes; how may I ever again see your holy Temple?
The waters were circling round me, even to the neck; the deep was about me; the sea-grass was twisted round my head.
I went down to the bases of the mountains; as for the earth, her walls were about me for ever: but you have taken up my life from the underworld, O Lord my God.
When my soul in me was overcome, I kept the memory of the Lord: and my prayer came in to you, into your holy Temple.
The worshippers of false gods have given up their only hope.
But I will make an offering to you with the voice of praise; I will give effect to my oaths. Salvation is the Lord's.
And at the Lord's order, the fish sent Jonah out of its mouth on to the dry land.
And the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time, saying,
Up! go to Nineveh, that great town, and give it the word which I have given you.
So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh as the Lord had said. Now Nineveh was a very great town, three days' journey from end to end.
And Jonah first of all went a day's journey into the town, and crying out said, In forty days destruction will overtake Nineveh.
And the people of Nineveh had belief in God; and a time was fixed for going without food, and they put on haircloth, from the greatest to the least.
And the word came to the king of Nineveh, and he got up from his seat of authority, and took off his robe, and covering himself with haircloth, took his seat in the dust.
And he had it given out in Nineveh, By the order of the king and his great men, no man or beast, herd or flock, is to have a taste of anything; let them have no food or water:
And let man and beast be covered with haircloth, and let them make strong prayers to God: and let everyone be turned from his evil way and the violent acts of their hands.
Who may say that God will not be turned, changing his purpose and turning away from his burning wrath, so that destruction may not overtake us?
And God saw what they did, how they were turned from their evil way; and God's purpose was changed as to the evil which he said he would do to them, and he did it not.
But this seemed very wrong to Jonah, and he was angry.
And he made prayer to the Lord and said , O Lord , is this not what I said when I was still in my country ? This is why I took care to go in flight to Tarshish : for I was certain that you were a loving God
, full of pity , slow to be angry and great in mercy , and ready to be turned from your purpose of evil .
So now, O Lord, give ear to my prayer and take my life from me; for death is better for me than life.
And the Lord said, Have you any right to be angry?
Then Jonah went out of the town, and took his seat on the east side of the town and made himself a roof of branches and took his seat under its shade till he saw what would become of the town.
And the Lord God made a vine come up over Jonah to give him shade over his head. And Jonah was very glad because of the vine.
But early on the morning after, God made ready a worm for the destruction of the vine, and it became dry and dead.
Then when the sun came up, God sent a burning east wind: and so great was the heat of the sun on his head that Jonah was overcome, and, requesting death for himself, said, Death is better for me than life.
And the Lord said to Jonah, Have you any right to be angry about the vine? And he said, I have a right to be truly angry.
And the Lord said, You had pity on the vine, for which you did no work and for the growth of which you were not responsible; which came up in a night and came to an end in a night;
And am I not to have mercy on Nineveh, that great town, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons without the power of judging between right and left, as well as much cattle?
Now after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, the word of the Lord came to Joshua, the son of Nun, Moses' helper, saying,
Moses my servant is dead; so now get up! Go over Jordan, you and all this people, into the land which I am giving to them, to the children of Israel.
Every place on which you put your foot I have given to you, as I said to Moses.
From the waste land and this mountain Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, and all the land of the Hittites to the Great Sea, in the west, will be your country.
While you are living, all will give way before you: as I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not take away my help from you or give you up.
Take heart and be strong; for you will give to this people for their heritage the land which I gave by an oath to their fathers.
Only take heart and be very strong; take care to do all the law which Moses my servant gave you, not turning from it to the right hand or to the left, so that you may do well in all your undertakings.
Let this book of the law be ever on your lips and in your thoughts day and night, so that you may keep with care everything in it; then a blessing will be on all your way, and you will do well.
Have I not given you your orders? Take heart and be strong; have no fear and do not be troubled; for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go,
Then Joshua gave their orders to those who were in authority over the people, saying,
Go through the tents and give orders to the people, saying, Get ready a store of food; for in three days you are to go over this river Jordan and take for your heritage the land which the Lord your God is giving you.
And to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,
Keep in mind what Moses, the servant of the Lord, said to you, The Lord your God is sending you rest and will give you this land.
Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle will be kept here in the land which Moses gave you on this side of Jordan; but you, the fighting-men, are to go over before your brothers, armed, to give them help;
Till the Lord has given your brothers rest , as he has given it to you , and they have taken their heritage in the land which the Lord your God is giving them : then you will go back to the land of your heritage which Moses , the
servant of the Lord , gave you on the east side of Jordan .
Then they said to Joshua in answer, Whatever you say to us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
As we gave attention to Moses in all things, so we will give attention to you: and may the Lord your God be with you as he was with Moses.
Whoever goes against your orders, and does not give attention to all your words, will be put to death: only take heart and be strong.
Now when it came to the ears of Adoni-zedek , king of Jerusalem , that Joshua had taken Ai , and had given it up to the curse ( for as he had done to Jericho and its king , so he had done to Ai and its king )
; and that the people of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were living among them ;
He was in great fear, because Gibeon was a great town, like one of the king's towns, greater than Ai, and all the men in it were men of war.
So Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, sent to Hoham, king of Hebron, and to Piram, king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia, king of Lachish, and to Debir, king of Eglon, saying,
Come up to me and give me help, and let us make an attack on Gibeon: for they have made peace with Joshua and the children of Israel.
So the five kings of the Amorites , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon , were banded together , and went up with all their armies and took up their position
before Gibeon and made war against it .
And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the tent-circle at Gilgal , saying , Be not slow to send help to your servants ; come up quickly to our support and keep us safe : for all the kings of the Amorites from the hill-country have come together
against us .
So Joshua went up from Gilgal with all his army and all his men of war.
And the Lord said to Joshua, Have no fear of them, for I have given them into your hands; they will all give way before you.
So Joshua, having come up from Gilgal all night, made a sudden attack on them.
And the Lord made them full of fear before Israel, and they put great numbers of them to death at Gibeon, and went after them by the way going up to Beth-horon, driving them back to Azekah and Makkedah
And in their flight before Israel , on the way down from Beth-horon , the Lord sent down great stones from heaven on them all the way to Azekah , causing their death : those whose death was caused by the stones were more than those whom the children of
Israel put to death with the sword .
It was on the day when the Lord gave up the Amorites into the hands of the children of Israel that Joshua said to the Lord , before the eyes of Israel , Sun , be at rest over Gibeon ; and you , O moon , in the valley
of Aijalon .
And the sun was at rest and the moon kept its place till the nation had given punishment to their attackers . ( Is it not recorded in the book of Jashar ? ) So the sun kept its place in the middle of the heavens , and was waiting
, and did not go down , for the space of a day .
And there was no day like that, before it or after it, when the Lord gave ear to the voice of a man; for the Lord was fighting for Israel.
And Joshua, with all Israel, went back to the tent-circle at Gilgal.
But these five kings went in flight secretly to a hole in the rock at Makkedah.
And word was given to Joshua that the five kings had been taken in a hole in the rock at Makkedah.
And Joshua said, Let great stones be rolled against the mouth of the hole, and let men keep watch by it:
But do you, without waiting, go after their army, attacking them from the back; do not let them get into their towns, for the Lord your God has given them into your hands.
Now when Joshua and the children of Israel had come to the end of their war of complete destruction, and had put to death all but a small band who had got safely into the walled towns,
All the people went back to Joshua to the tent-circle at Makkedah in peace: and no one said a word against the children of Israel.
Then Joshua said, Take away the stones from the mouth of the hole in the rock, and make those five kings come out to me.
And they did so, and made those five kings come out of the hole to him, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
And when they had made those kings come out to Joshua , Joshua sent for all the men of Israel , and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him , Come near and put your feet on the necks of these kings .
So they came near and put their feet on their necks .
And Joshua said to them, Have no fear and do not be troubled; be strong and take heart: for so will the Lord do to all against whom you make war.
Then Joshua had them put to death, hanging them on five trees, where they were till evening.
And when the sun went down , they were taken down from the trees , by Joshua ' s orders , and put into the hole where they had gone to be safe ; and great stones were placed at the mouth of the hole , where they are to
this day .
That day Joshua took Makkedah, and put it and its king to the sword; every soul in it he gave up to the curse without mercy: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
Then Joshua and all Israel with him went on from Makkedah and came to Libnah, and made an attack on it;
And again the Lord gave it and its king into the hands of Israel; and he put it and every person in it to the sword, till their destruction was complete; and he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.
Then Joshua and all Israel with him went on from Libnah to Lachish, and took up their position against it and made an attack on it,
And the Lord gave Lachish into the hands of Israel, and on the second day he took it, putting it and every person in it to the sword without mercy, as he had done to Libnah.
Then Horam, king of Gezer, came up to the help of Lachish; and Joshua overcame him and his people, putting all of them to death.
And Joshua and all Israel with him went on from Lachish to Eglon: and they took up their position against it and made an attack on it;
And that day they took it, putting it and every person in it to the sword, as he had done to Lachish.
And Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron, and made an attack on it;
And took it , overcoming it and putting it and its king and its towns and every person in it to the sword : as he had done to Eglon , he put them all to death , and gave it up to the curse with every person in it
And Joshua and all Israel with him went on to make an attack on Debir;
And he took it , with its king and all its towns : and he put them to the sword , giving every person in it to the curse ; all were put to death : as he had done to Hebron , so he did to Debir and its
king .
So Joshua overcame all the land , the hill-country and the South and the lowland and the mountain slopes , and all their kings ; all were put to death : and every living thing he gave up to the curse , as the Lord , the God of Israel
, had given him orders .
Joshua overcame them from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, and all the land of Goshen as far as Gibeon.
And all these kings and their land Joshua took at the same time, because the Lord, the God of Israel, was fighting for Israel.
Then Joshua and all Israel with him went back to their tents at Gilgal.
Now Jabin, king of Hazor, hearing of these things, sent to Jobab, king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,
And to the kings on the north in the hill-country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in the highlands of Dor on the west,
And to the Canaanites on the east and on the west, and to the Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the hill-country, and the Hivites under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
And they went out, they and all their armies with them, a great people, in number like the sand on the seaside, with horses and war-carriages in great number.
And all these kings came together, and put their forces in position at the waters of Merom, to make war on Israel.
And the Lord said to Joshua, Have no fear of them: for tomorrow at this time I will give them all up dead before Israel; you are to have the leg-muscles of their horses cut and their war-carriages burned with fire.
So Joshua and all the men of war with him came against them suddenly at the waters of Merom, and made an attack on them.
And the Lord gave them up into the hands of Israel, and they overcame them driving them back to great Zidon and to Misrephoth-maim and into the valley of Mizpeh to the east; and they put them all to death, no man got away safely.
And Joshua did to them as the Lord had said to him; he had the leg-muscles of their horses cut and their war-carriages burned with fire.
At that time, Joshua went on to take Hazor and put its king to the sword: for in earlier times Hazor was the chief of all those kingdoms.
And they put every person in it to death without mercy, giving every living thing up to the curse, and burning Hazor.
And all the towns of these kings, and all the kings, Joshua took, and put them to the sword: he gave them up to the curse, as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had said.
As for the towns made on hills of earth, not one was burned by Israel but Hazor, which was burned by Joshua.
And all the goods taken from these towns, and their cattle, the children of Israel kept for themselves; but every man they put to death without mercy, till their destruction was complete, and there was no one living.
As the Lord had given orders to Moses his servant, so Moses gave orders to Joshua, and so Joshua did; every order which the Lord had given to Moses was done.
So Joshua took all that land, the hill-country and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland and the Arabah, the hill-country of Israel and its lowland;
From Mount Halak, which goes up to Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon: and all their kings he overcame and put to death.
For a long time Joshua made war on all those kings.
Not one town made peace with the children of Israel, but only the Hivites of Gibeon: they took them all in war.
For the Lord made them strong in heart to go to war against Israel, so that he might give them up to the curse without mercy, and that destruction might come on them, as the Lord had given orders to Moses.
And Joshua came at that time and put an end to the Anakim in the hill-country, in Hebron, in Debir, in Anab, and in all the hill-country of Judah and Israel: Joshua gave them and their towns to the curse.
Not one of the Anakim was to be seen in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, some were still living.
So Joshua took all the land, as the Lord had said to Moses; and Joshua gave it to the children of Israel as their heritage, making division of it among them by their tribes. And the land had rest from war.
Now these are the kings of the land whom the children of Israel overcame, taking as their heritage their land on the east side of Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah to the east:
Sihon , king of the Amorites , who was living in Heshbon , ruling from Aroer , which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , and the town in the middle of the valley , and half Gilead , as far as the river Jabbok ,
the limits of the children of Ammon ;
And the Arabah to the sea of Chinneroth, to the east, and to the sea of the Arabah, that is the Salt Sea, to the east, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah:
And the land of Og, king of Bashan, of the rest of the Rephaim, who was living at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
Ruling in the mountain of Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, as far as the limits of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half Gilead, to the land of Sihon, king of Heshbon.
Moses, the servant of the Lord, and the children of Israel overcame them; and Moses, the servant of the Lord, gave their land for a heritage to the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
And these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children of Israel overcame on the west side of Jordan , from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak , which goes up to Seir ; and Joshua gave the land to the tribes of Israel
for a heritage , in keeping with their divisions ;
In the hill-country , and in the lowland , and in the Arabah , and on the mountain slopes , and in the waste land , and in the South ; the Hittites , the Amorites , and the Canaanites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites
